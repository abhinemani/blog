<p>I've spoken internationally about government, technology and innovation, ranging from conferences such as SXSW or DataPalooza to universities and institutions such as the World Bank and Stanford. I tend to talk about how cities are changing, and using technology to do more with less in the 21st century &#8212; and how entreprenuers can take advantage of that. (For a good sense of how I think about this field, have a look at my "<a href="http://govtech.com/data/7-Tactics-for-21st-Century-Cities.html">7 Principles for 21st Century Cities</a>.")</p> 
<p>Over time, I've gotten to see the idea of civic innovation go from the abstract to the real, and I get excited about working with groups to understand how those lessons could apply to their work. </p>
