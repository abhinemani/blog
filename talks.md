<figcaption>Illustrated Notes from the Agile Alliance Keynote</figcaption>
<p>I've spoken internationally about government, techonology and innovation, ranging from conferences such as SXSW or DataPalooza to universities and institutions such as the World Bank and Stanford. I tend to talk about Code for America and what we're learning on topics like how to create an innovative culture or how to leverage open data; what are best practices in open data or citizen engagement; and why entreprenuers should consider civic startups.</p>
