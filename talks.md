<p>I've spoken internationally about government, technology, and innovation, ranging from conferences such as SXSW or DataPalooza to universities and institutions such as the World Bank and Stanford. I tend to talk about <a href="https://medium.com/civic-technology/government-is-what-you-make-of-it-d836a6a9353d#.30ist7dak" target="_blank"> how governments are changing,</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/civic-technology/the-open-data-ecosystem-cd7f1c13bc0f?source=latest---------4" target="_blank">using technology to do more with less</a> in the 21st century &#8212; and <a href="https://medium.com/civic-technology/disruption-as-a-public-service-a9de086b171f?source=latest---------2" target="_blank">how entreprenuers can take advantage of that</a>. </p> 
<p>If you are looking for insight on government technology, innovation, or civic engagement at your next event or conference, don't hesitate to <a href="mailto:abhi.nemani@gmail.com">get in touch</a>.</p>
