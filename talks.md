<p>I've spoken internationally about government, technology and innovation, ranging from conferences such as SXSW or DataPalooza to universities and institutions such as the World Bank and Stanford. I tend to talk about how cities are changing, and using technology to do more with less in the 21st century &#8212; and how entreprenuers can take advantage of that. </p> 
<p>If you are looking for insight on government technology, innovation, or civic engagement at your next event or conference, don't hesitate to <a href="mailto:abhinemani@gmail.com">get in touch</a>.</p>
