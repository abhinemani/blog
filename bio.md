<p>Previously, Mayor Kevin Johnson of Sacramento appointed him as <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/sacramento/news/2016/03/16/meet-sacramentos-chief-officer-of-innovation.html" target="_blank"><strong>interim Chief Innovation Officer</strong></a> to build out the city's budding startup sector, through <a href="http://civichall.org/civicist/sacramento-approves-10-million-largest-city-innovation-fund-us/#.V3WiMAPum64.twitter" target="_blank">venture investments, grants, and partnerships</a>. Before that, he served as the <a href="http://abhinemani.com/press/latech/" target="_blank"><strong>first Chief Data Officer for the City of Los Angeles</strong></a>, where he led the city's efforts to build an open and data-driven LA. As CDO, Abhi led Los Angeles to <a href="http://abhinemani.com/press/techwire/">the #1 ranking for US open data cities</a> and mobilized LA's growing developer community through multiple events and challenges to put <a href="http://data.lacity.org" target="_blank">that data</a> to work.

Abhi led CfA’s product strategy as its teams tackled local government challenges ranging from transparency and business licensing to food stamps and public safety. He also led the organization's efforts to scale through building multiple new programs: a first-of-its-kind civic startup accelerator, an international volunteer corps, and a collaborative network for hundreds of government innovators. Additionally, Abhi developed the organization’s policy portfolio — working hand-in-hand with area experts and local leaders — to enact over 30 municipal policy reforms on topics including open data, healthcare, and procurement.</p>
