# Abhi Nemani

Personal website built with Jekyll using **[Minimal Mistakes](http://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes)**, a responsive Jekyll theme. 

## Notes

* The list of speaking engagements is managed on a Google Spreadsheet and published through Sheetsee, a simple JS tool.
* Press clips are aggregated through a additional post type; those tagged "featured" are included on the homepage.
* Slight customizations were made to the Minimal Mistakes template to enable the "author bio" section to appear on all pages.

## Basic Setup

1. [Install Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) if you haven't already.
2. Fork the [Minimal Mistakes repo](http://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/)
3. Make it your own and customize, customize, customize.

**Pro-tip:** Delete the `gh-pages` branch after cloning and start fresh by branching off `master`. There is a bunch of garbage in `gh-pages` used for the theme's demo site that I'm guessing you don't want on your site.

## License

This is [MIT](LICENSE) with no added caveats, so feel free to use this Jekyll theme on your site without linking back to me or using a disclaimer.

If you'd like give me credit somewhere on your blog or tweet a shout out to
[@mmistakes](https://twitter.com/mmistakes), that would be pretty sweet.
