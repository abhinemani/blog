		<content:encoded><![CDATA[At the beginning of his presidency, John F. Kennedy let every nation know “that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe, in order to assure the survival and the success of liberty.” In that, he inherits the centuries old liberal struggle: the defense of freedom from its enemies and competitors. The liberal camp, though, hosts as much cacophony as it does passion. With their prioritization of liberty often comes recognition of its complexity, and so thinkers debate its justification and its best defense. Milton Friedman, a Nobel-winning economist, understandably champions the markets role in maintaining and expanding liberty. When contrasted with Alexis de Tocqueville’s liberalism, Friedman’s seems insufficient and unsatisfying. Legitimated in his shallow self-interest, man is slavish for profits, an economic brute, and his society is ripe for despotism. But as Tocqueville rightly points out, man can and should aim higher towards the common good, towards everyday virtue, because in a democracy, that’s what it means to be <em>free</em>.

Milton Friedman’s support of free enterprise stems from practical and philosophical roots, and to appreciate the role they play in conception of society, we must see how he grounds them.
<h2>Friedman’s Free Markets</h2>
Milton Friedman emphasis on the free market proceeds from, in part, a distrust of government action. He argues that when government attempts to substitute its own judgments for the judgments of free people, the results are usually disastrous. In contrast to the free market’s invisible hand, which improves the lives of people, the government’s oversized foot tramples on people’s hopes and often destroys their dreams. Empiricism buttresses his claim. He vocally decried bureaucratic inefficiency and failure in his public addresses, with particular ire for social security, the minimum wage, and Medicare. In the first place, then, Friedman is a pragmatist. Even if he were to agree that justice requires certain services or programs (which he wouldn’t), he would buck the governmental path: it would not get you where you (think you) <em>need</em> to go.

Free markets are better equipped, he claims, to meet needs. Cognizant of their inevitable imperfection, he embraces markets as hotbeds of creativity, innovation, and efficiency—three things often missing from governmental bureaucracy. Even a flawed market produces better results than arrogant experts and grasping bureaucrats. His famed pencil allegory illustrates the market’s power. Each little piece—the eraser, the lead, the wood, and even the glue—come from different countries and different producers—different cultures and different people. The market transcends geographical, ideological, and national barriers to organically meet men’s needs on a massive scale but at minimized price. Put another way, markets are better, strong, and faster.

Thus, on purely practical grounds, free markets should be prioritized. But Milton Friedman does not object to government controls solely because they are ineffective. His deeper objections flow from a moral framework. As he lays out in the first chapter:

Economic arrangements play a dual role in the promotion of a free society. On the one hand, freedom in economic arrangements is itself a component of freedom broadly understood, so economic freedom is an end in itself. In the second place, economic freedom is also an indispensable means toward the achievement of political freedom.<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a>

This dual conception of liberty underpins Friedman’s liberalism, which is essentially a classical, Smithian liberalism.  He explains, "The heart of the liberal philosophy is a belief in the dignity of the individual, in his freedom to make the most of his capacities and opportunities according to his own lights... This implies a belief in the equality of man in one sense; in their inequality in another.”<a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a> Liberty is a constitutive element of human dignity, and a dignified life, thus, has choice. Economic liberty—that is, transactional choice—is justified than on these grounds alone: man should be free to trade on his natural endowments for whatever he chooses. But Friedman goes further, tying economic freedom to political freedom. As Milton Friedman has written, “I know of no society that has been marked by a large measure of political freedom, and that has not also used something comparable to a free market to organize the bulk of economic activity.”<a href="#_ftn3">[3]</a> Free enterprise has, to borrow Amartya Sen’s terms, both intrinsic and instrumental value; it is both a bastion and a bulwark of liberty.

As a market-advocating liberal, Friedman is persuasive. Missing in his argumentation is the intuitive step from dignity to liberty, but it is easily filled with an injection of the concept of self-government. A dignified man, essentially equal to others, merits self-governance, autonomy over himself. Another cannot control his actions or beliefs <em>a priori</em>.  Freedom is thus his right, and society must scaffold pluralism as its moral framework. Connected with above pragmatic arguments, liberty itself has, again along with Sen’s analysis, instrumental and intrinsic value: it advances human conditions with innovation and efficiency, and it realizes human existence with choice and opportunity.
<h2>Friedman’s Hope: Limited Government</h2>
Friedman’s more controversial analysis tackles public policy, or more specifically the role of government in a free society. The analysis to a point is rather simplistic: increased government intervention in the free market not only distorts it but also shrinks it. For example, a minimum wage policy, he claims, saps efficiency and constricts the employer’s choice—a practical and moral failure. More subtly, though, he advances a deeper argument. As he summarized in a TV interview while describing a previous lecture:

And I gave a talk at the Catholic University of Chile under the title ‘The Fragility of Freedom.’ The essence of the talk was that freedom was a very fragile thing and that what destroyed it more than anything else was central control; that in order to maintain freedom, you had to have free markets, and that free markets would work best if you had political freedom. So it was essentially an anti-totalitarian talk… Oh, absolutely. The emphasis of that talk was that free markets would undermine political centralization and political control.<a href="#_ftn4">[4]</a>

Friedman betrays his twin fears: political centralization and political control. He considers them dangerous but popular stepping-stones to totalitarianism. He reasoning is seen in <em>Capitalism and Freedom</em>. Friedman appreciate the necessity of states in modern politics to regulate and guard the markets, but this watchdog, he claims, is often unleashed to chase after chimerical welfare programs. In the pursuit of however beneficent agendas, societies accept or even demand centralization to ensure reach and consistency. The administrative stamp of progress often crushes individual liberty. Enter political control. The sphere of “just” political action is enlarged, effectively upending the terrain for individual action. The upshot is a collectivist mentality and an ever-expansive Centre. Collectivism saps morality, he ventures, accrediting the doctrine of “social responsibility” with the “decline in the moral climate.” He argues with the rhetorical question, “If you adopt the view that a man is not responsible for his own behavior, that somehow or other society is responsible, why should he seek to make his behavior good?”<a href="#_ftn5">[5]</a> The other effect, increased governmental action, too erodes morality, since, “Whenever we depart from voluntary cooperation and try to do good by using force, the bad moral value of force triumphs over good intentions.”<a href="#_ftn6">[6]</a> The good intentions, though, are intoxicating, especially when served by a robust state. This “tendency” ushers in more reforms and, it apparently follows, less liberty.

Friedman’s conception essentially purifies capitalistic profit maximization of negative connotation and enshrines it as the bulwark of free society. Capitalism <em>is</em> freedom, apparently. The government would have a limited role, then, an “umpire” for the game of free enterprise.

Friedman overlooks, though, that there are losers in that game—always someone and in the long run, possibly everyone. He effectively forgot the Tocquevillean lesson of moderation: unchecked capitalism can lead to materialism, which can corrode the very liberty he loves.
<h2>Tocqueville’s Liberal Democratic Theory</h2>
In many ways, Tocqueville and Friedman seem related: both prioritize liberty, both fear administrative centralization, and both recognize the despotic tendencies of democracy. An appreciation of Tocqueville’s analysis, though, renders Friedman’s myopic. He traces the tendencies Friedman bemoans and Friedman’s views as well back to their sociological source—the equality of conditions—and it is from that perspective Tocqueville defends liberty, not as a self-evident virtue, but as a potential for virtue. Thus, both Tocqueville’s perspective and his conception of freedom differentiate him from Friedman and underpin a more nuanced democratic theory, one that situates capitalism in an ordered liberty.

Whereas Friedman made intuitive and empirical claims about human nature, Tocqueville offers historical ones. Looking back through the course of modern history, he perceived the “providential fact” of democratization—both politically and, more importantly, socially. Political democracy comes in the form of democratic institutions—liberal, representative legislatures, for example—and social democracy come in the space of men’s minds: man recognizes an essential equality. This sense precipitates further social democratization and an (insatiable) drive towards equality of conditions. These twin forces present the fundamental tension of modern democracy between liberty and equality. The affection of equality is greater in democratic limes, as Tocqueville laments:

“I think that democratic communities have a natural taste for freedom; left to themselves, they will seek it, cherish it, and view and privation of it with regret. But for equality their passion is ardent, insatiable, incessant, invincible; they call for equality in freedom; and if they cannot obtain that, they still call for equality in slavery. They will endure poverty, servitude, barbarism, but they will not endure aristocracy.”<a href="#_ftn7">[7]</a>

The tone of this passage betrays his bias: Tocqueville is a liberal. He offers one explanation in a letter to Beaumont, “I have never been more profoundly convinced that [liberty] alone can give to human societies in general, and to the individuals who compose them in particular, all the prosperity and greatness which our species is capable.”<a href="#_ftn8">[8]</a> Better put, that statement matches the instrumental justification of liberty Friedman champions. But Tocqueville goes further: “Freedom is a <em>sacred</em> thing. There is one thing else that better deserves the name: that is virtue. But then what is virtue if not the free choice of what is good.”<a href="#_ftn9">[9]</a> Liberty, thus, allows for individual virtue; it is not simply beneficial to society or civilization, but also to man—it constitutes moral terrain. When government forces action, even if moral, it appropriates that ground, dissolving virtue and, in effect, upending man’s morality. The same happen when man relinquishes his liberty; he has no footing to grasp virtue. This too seems to parallel Friedman, as he ribbed the hypocrisy of forced charity, but the distinction comes with the use of “virtue,” a term which Friedman hardly uses and one he even dismissed in a televised interview.<a href="#_ftn10">[10]</a><a href="#_ftn11">[11]</a> For Tocqueville, though, liberty is essential bound to virtue, so and it is in his conception of virtue we see the contrast of his liberalism.

In <em>Democracy in America</em>, Tocqueville quotes Cotton Mather on the nature of liberty in a democratic society: “Now would I have you mistake the point of your own liberty. There is a liberty of corrupt nature, which is affected by men and beasts to do what they list; and this liberty is inconsistent with authority, impatient of all restraint… But there is a civil, a moral, a federal liberty, which is the proper end and object of authority; it is a liberty for that only which is just and good.”<a href="#_ftn12">[12]</a> Scholar Michael Barone, writing on liberty and truth, elaborates: “In the succinct formulation of Lord Action, liberty is not to be defined as the ‘power of doing what we like, but the right of being able to do what we ought.’”<a href="#_ftn13">[13]</a>
<h2>Rightly Understanding Self-Interest</h2>
Tocqueville fills in the normative void in Volume II. He writes, “It must therefore be expected that personal interest will become more than ever the principal if not the sole spring of men's actions; but it remains to be seen how each man will understand his personal interest.” Fortunately, he ventures, America have rightly understood self-interest. It “produces no great acts of self-sacrifice, but it suggests daily small acts of self-denial,” and in that cultivates a health sense of community and greater purpose. Man identifies himself with the larger whole, and collectivism—whether he knows it or not—becomes his fundamental ethos. “By itself it cannot suffice to make a man virtuous; but it disciplines a number of persons in habits of regularity, temperance, moderation, foresight, self-command; and if it does not lead men straight to virtue by the will, it gradually draws them in that direction by their habits.”<a href="#_ftn14">[14]</a> Thus, self-interest right understood trains man in democratic virtue, a collectivist ethos, which smoothes the democratic process and underpins democratic society. But Tocqueville goes further; he substantiates his preference for raising self-interest with an Aristotelian analysis of man:

Whatever elevates, enlarges, and expands the soul renders it more capable of succeeding in those very undertakings which do not concern it. Whatever, on the other hand, enervates or lowers it weakens it for all purposes, the chief as well as the least, and threatens to render it almost equally impotent for both. Hence the soul must remain great and strong, though it were only to devote its strength and greatness from time to time to the service of the body. If men were ever to content themselves with material objects, it is probable that they would lose by degrees the art of producing them; and they would enjoy them in the end, like the brutes, without discernment and without improvement.<a href="#_ftn15">[15]</a>

In the first place, this distinguishes Tocqueville from Friedman. The economist focused on the individual and the maintenance of her liberty, and he, in fact, decries collectivist mentality, as it overpowers an individual’s will. Following Tocquevillle’s observations, though, that opposition seems false: individual interest can align with collective interest, and with self-interest rightly understood it usually does. This assessment, though, comes with a normative force for Tocqueville, which further distances him from Friedman. This sense of collectivism is crucial to combat the quiet threats to liberty: individualism and materialism.
<h2>The Quiet Threats to Democracy</h2>
Both springs from the same source: equality. Uncaged from class, each man is free and able to get and do what he would like, and now that men <em>can</em> have anything, men <em>do</em> want everything, since another man may have it. You’re always concerned with keeping up with the Jones’s. He observed, “The love of well-being has now become the predominant taste of the nation; the great current of human passions runs in that channel and sweeps everything along in its course.”<a href="#_ftn16">[16]</a> This tides carries man towards commerce and industry and, more importantly, onto his own affairs, his own interests, himself. Economic concerns, according to Tocqueville, then drown out political ones. The twin evils come to the fore. With the economic mindset, individualism shuts his doors to society, so it atomizes. With thirst for physical gratification, materialism deemphasizes collectivism, so it wanes.  What’s left? A fragmented, shallow society and an enfeebled, unattended democracy.

Tocqueville contends that there is a natural disposition in democracy towards strong central power, as the economic man wants stability and the independent man feels powerless.  The abdication to central administrative power seems like a good bargain: trade an increasingly burdensome liberty for peace of mind at no loss to equality. And so Tocqueville’s analysis arrives at Friedman’s despotic nightmare, but the arc is distinct. Materialism and individualism are products of low self-interest, and both are cultivated by rampant commercialism. Unrestrained and overemphasized capitalism should be avoided, according to Tocqueville, as it will only ease the ground for despotism.  In fact, he envisioned the way in which "a natural impulse is throwing up an aristocracy out of the bosom of democracy.”<a href="#_ftn17">[17]</a> Even in the 1830s, when he himself considered American capitalism soft and beneficent, he prophesized of the rise of the manufacturers and the effectual creation of an aristocracy.

In manufacturing, as Tocqueville sees it, there is a fundamental disconnect with the “workman” and the “master.” He explains, “While the workman concentrates his faculties more and more upon the study of a single detail, the master surveys an extensive whole, and the mind of the latter is enlarged in proportion as that of the former is narrowed.”<a href="#_ftn18">[18]</a> Over time the effects grow pernicious, a developed real and psychological inequality. They live in separate realms, nearly, and “[The master] resembles more and more the administrator of a vast empire; [the workman], a brute.”<a href="#_ftn19">[19]</a> The upshot of this disconnect is a severing of humanitarian ties: “Not only are the rich not compactly united among themselves, but there is no real bond between them and the poor.”<a href="#_ftn20">[20]</a> Under the guise of economic rationality, then, the rich can abandon the poor and leave their well being to the by the “charity of the public.” He aptly summarize, “In their intense and exclusive anxiety to make a fortune they lose sight of the close connection that exists between the private fortune of each and the prosperity of all.”<a href="#_ftn21">[21]</a> Thus, rampant capitalism severs the individual from the collective, and so eases the atomization of society. The atomized society is ripe for the soft despotism.
<h2>Adjudicating the Dispute</h2>
Tocqueville’s own prose summarizes his contrast with Friedman.

<blockquote>A nation that asks nothing of its government but the maintenance of order is already a slave at heart, the slave of its own well-being, awaiting only the hand that will bind it. By such a nation the despotism of faction is not less to be dreaded than the despotism of an individual. When the bulk of the community are engrossed by private concerns, the smallest parties need not despair of getting the upper hand in public affairs. At such times it is not rare to see on the great stage of the world, as we see in our theaters, a multitude represented by a few players, who alone speak in the name of an absent or inattentive crowd: they alone are in action, while all others are stationary; they regulate everything by their own caprice; they change the laws and tyrannize at will over the manners of the country, and then men wonder to see into how small a number of weak and worthless hands a great people may fall.<a href="#_ftn22">[22]</a>
</blockquote>

This is the underbelly of capitalism Friedman masks. It erodes society and threatens liberty. Driven by shallow self-interest, man may enjoy his liberty, but it grows increasingly instrumental: a tool for the defense of his own property and for the assurance of sufficient tranquility he need to enjoy it. Tranquility, though, is a despot’s favorite sell, so this conception liberty is constantly in danger of giving way to equality and despotism. A liberal should fear that slide, not ease it. Friedman’s rightly insists on decentralization and libertarianism, but in enshrining economic rationality as the general ethos—eschewing collectivism and lauding profit maximization—he endangers the survival of liberty in an imperfect world.

In effect, the Financial Crisis of 2008 adjudicates this dispute: regrettably Tocqueville was right. A society that unleashes materialism and uncages vice, forgets, to paraphrase JFK, that those who foolishly seek power by riding the back of the tiger end up inside.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3><strong><em>...And He Won’t Bowl Alone</em></strong></h3>
“I have two majors, an overloaded curriculum, and three jobs. But the majority of my time isn't spent in class, studying, or doing work. Meetings and emails overload my Crackberry. It’s muted but its constant vibrations remind me: I don’t have time to bowl alone. I pencil in dates and plan out parties; I’m social, but scheduled. Hi, I’m Organization Kid.<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a> Great to meet you Dr. Putnam, but can we walk while we talk?”

A bewildered Robert Putnam: “I guess so.”<a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a><!--more-->

“Great. I’m really happy David Brooks arranged our little chat. Your work gets a lot of play here: Psychology, IR, Gov—the professors love you. The students… not so much.”

More surprised than offended, Putnam asks, “Why do you say that? Conservative school with a public-service bend, Claremont McKenna, I figured, would appreciate not only the traditionalism of social capital, but also its power. You kids want to run the world, don’t you? This is what makes the world run.”

“Right, we do, and we get it,” the kid reassures him, continuing, “The theory is well known. Society is knit together by dense networks of associations, and that fabric facilitates collective action. Since you’re bound to the group, you work with the group.” He pauses and then concludes, “It’s kind of like large-scale peer pressure. Yes, this is college, and we get that.”

“Not bad, if a bit simplified. There are more meaningful effects too.” The conservation seems more like lightning-round sparring. “Networks of civic engagement house the memories of cooperative success, which serve as a kind of template for future action. You learn how to get things done—together. Plus, the networks of interaction broaden the participants' sense of self, developing the ‘I’ into the ‘we.’ And for <em>my</em> sake, do you mind if <em>we</em> sit down for a bit?”

Glancing at his phone first, the kid smiles and responds, “Of course, let’s make this a lunch.“ They head toward the dining hall, without skipping a beat, the kid continues: “Now, Dr. Putnam, to be fair, I’ve heard that story before. First semester, freshman year: Introduction to American Politics. And, well, it was more eloquently put by a Frenchman, Alexis de Tocqueville.”

“I owe a lot to Tocqueville. He was the modern forefather of this whole school of thought. One of the first to recognize the connections between mores and institutions, between civil society and politics. My social capital is his self-interest rightly understood with charts and graphs.” Putnam now had a humbled tone, “I am really just elaborating on and quantifying his thinking.”

“I like it: you’re our civil society accountant.” He adds a light laugh to ensure the quip isn’t rendered insolence. “I bet it’s tough, though, to quantify associational psychology. I’m curious, how did you decide upon methodology?” Posing that question, he directed them toward seats at the end of table already cluttered with clusters of chatty coeds.

Putnam sets this things down and explains, “Tocqueville had his travels; I had my surveys. There’s a wealth of information on public attitudes and activities, and I map certain traits to trends in social capital in contemporary America. It’s basically an input-output study—with many variables. The inputs are the causes of social capital—associational activity, familial ties, and the like; the outputs are its effects—civic participation and societal trust.”

“But no interviews right?<a href="#_ftn3">[3]</a>” The kid was getting somewhere.

“No, casual interviews would not have been academically rigorous,” he rebuffed. “This was a political science study.”

“They were good enough for Tocqueville. Well, they were all he had, but through his casual interviews he produced your school of thought. More importantly, he was able to connect his observations to the democratic experience, the <em>what</em> to the <em>why</em>.” Putnam had fallen into the kid’s trap: “From my reading, <em>why</em> is a question you have some trouble with.”

“I’ll admit that. I offer some possible explanations for the decline in social capital, but I can’t do more than infer. That said, the evidence of decline (of both inputs and outputs) is staggering.”

“Right, I remember: bowling leagues have floundered, and with them, the social interactions and civic conversations over beer, pizza, and pretzels that solo bowlers do without.” The kid was nearly quoting Putnam’s essay, “now, we bowl alone.”

“Yes, that one of the more whimsical examples; it illustrates the trend. Social capital inputs have dropped.” This was his familiar line. Now he was working from muscle memory, “Since the 1960s, Churchgoing slipped from roughly 15 percent. Since the mid-1950s, when union membership peaked, the nonagricultural union rosters have cut by more than half. The Boy Scouts are off by 26 percent since 1970, and the Red Cross off by 61. In sum, after expanding steadily throughout most of this century, many major civic organizations have experienced a sudden, substantial, and nearly simultaneous decline in membership over the last decade or two. We aren’t just bowling alone, we’re living alone.”

Overwhelmed but still in control, the kid queries, “We’ll come back to that. What about outputs? How do you know those declines translate to less trust or cooperation?”

“We measured them. From a relative high point in the early 1960s, voter turnout had by 1990 declined by nearly a quarter, and kids your age are the culprits, with youth voting in 2000 at tepid levels. The trend persists outside the voting booth: the proportion of Americans who socialize with their neighbors has slowly but steadily declined over the last two decades, from 72 percent to 61 percent. Even worse, the proportion of Americans saying that most people can be trusted fell by more than a third between 1960, when 58 percent chose that alternative, and 1993, when only 37 percent did. We are less connected to each other and less trusting of each other. That’s a net loss of social capital.”

“All due respect, Dr. Putnam, I think here’s where your argument shows its age.” He was somehow both polite and combative. “Maybe we <em>were</em> less connected to each other, but now we <em>aren’t</em>. You know how I know? While we’ve been talking my Blackberry has buzzed about 10 times.” The kid hands over his blinking toy.

The professor was amused, “Explain.” And the professor became the student.

“You’re right: the traditional structures of communication and associations have fallen down, but new, more diffuse ones have cropped up in their place. Your vision of community centers and bowling leagues is dated. I am in constant contact with my friends and family, and my personal network grows constantly: MySpace, Facebook, Linkedin. Online social networks are the modern town square. We talk, we debate, we laugh, and we even flirt. Hard as it is to believe, there’s real human interaction on a global scale happening constantly.”<a href="#_ftn4">[4]</a>

“But you’ve just individualized leisure,” intimating he’d heard this tact before. “See, these technological trends may in fact be atomizing society, entrenching you all behind your laptops. You don’t bowl at all; you play video games. Your computer is basically a modern television, which has made our communities wider and shallower. You don’t have to leave the house to be entertained, so you don’t. We used to come together at movie theaters, at shopping malls, in parks, but now you can watch, shop, and relax all on your own. Technology may in fact be driving a wedge between our individual interests and our collective interactions. I’m left to ask, how does this technology facilitate <em>meaningful</em> social interaction?”

“The same way we have it in the non-wired world. Peer pressure.” He searched for a moment and then returned, “Have you heard of <em>Causes</em>?” Without waiting for a response, he continues, “It’s an online organization and application that have changed the way non-profits win support. Instead of solely relying on big donors or large contributions, they’ve infiltrated social networks thanks to some clever engineering and gone viral. Members can “support” organizations with funds (online contributions), door knocks (emails), or just advertising space (a badge) on their profile. Just as importantly, each time one of your friends joins on, you’re reminded of what you could be doing. That’s one of the many reasons charitable giving and support are <em>at record levels</em>.<a href="#_ftn5">[5]</a> Your metrics are off.”

Putnam grew defensive, “Donations alone don’t instill a sense of membership. Remember your Tocqueville: you have to work together to accomplish something.”

“We’re doing that too. Online and off. Just because there aren’t protests or rebels doesn’t mean we aren’t engaged and connected. Your stats on civic participation, by the way, are way off.”

“How do you know?”

“You <em>really</em> think we aren’t political,” the kid insinuated disbelief. “Two of my internships were in politics, and I’m majoring in government. Plus, youth turnout is on the rise. In the 2008 presidential election, there were 3.4 million more voters as compared to the 2004. Compared to 2000, the increase in youth turnout is at least 11 percentage points. In general, overall turnout has returned to the highs of the 60s.

Impressed, Putnam rebuffs, “It is not just the voting booth that matters. My research showed that from 1973-1993, the numbers of Americans who attended one civic meeting annually has fallen by more than a third. You might be voting, but are you engaged in the broader process?”

“We’ve matched that turnout with enthusiasm. In the last presidential campaign, millions of young people not only voted, but also volunteered. In part, we’ve moved the discussion from the town hall online: 12 percent of us have posted their own political commentary or writing to an online newsgroup, website or blog.<a href="#_ftn6">[6]</a> And we get it: communities matter. 63 percent of us believe the role of government should be to promote the principle of a strong community, and 71 percent think political engagement was an effective way of solving important issues facing our community.<a href="#_ftn7">[7]</a> Plus, we have more and new communities. Consider the open-source movement. Better yet, you must know of wikis.”

“I <em>am</em> a professor.”

“Exactly. Consider the prominence wikipedia has had in our daily dialogue and study. Have a question? First thing we do is google or wiki it. No answer? We’ll keep looking any then update the wikipedia page ourselves.  It’s a community driven dictionary, and though you may not, we trust it—at least as a springboard. These open-sourced—that is group run and developed—projects have upended traditional production schemes. Software isn’t made by one guy sitting in his dorm room; it’s made by hundreds spread across the globe, each chipping in and working together to constantly improve the product. Your generation had groupthink. For us, it’s group-do.” The kid was pleased with himself.

Putnam didn’t let up, “But do you do good? If all you’re doing is helping yourself or wasting time, your associations are trivial and meaningless. Associations are supposed to broaden self-interest. A note-sharing website doesn’t embody democratic virtue.”

“I remember these chapters from <em>Democracy in America</em>. We have to learn the ‘art of being free.’ Well, no one had to teach me. I’m a member of five campus organizations, I have summer internships at NGOs, and I help with student government. We don’t just associate online, we work together on the ground, too. I remember, a friend saying ‘I hadn't been on campus more than five minutes before I started hearing about all the students who do community service—tutoring at a charter school in Trenton, working at Habitat for Humanity-style building projects, serving food at soup kitchens.’ So they have similar resumes, I mean commitments too.”

Surprised, Putnam ask, “Why?  You are double-majoring at a prestigious institution, and you have a job. How do you have time to socialize and associate?”

“It’s what we do,” the kid said as a matter of fact. “It’s a feverishly competitive world out there, and since I was young, the insistence has always been on success. I always knew that I would have to work hard to do well, but I trusted the system, the meritocracy. If I earned it, I would get it. It’s a national trend too. Consider sales of Baby Einstein or Ritalin: parents are honing their children’s potential. They know they have to work to let their children succeed.”

“Why do you trust the system? Why not be yourself or rebel?”

“We live in the age of the SAT, No Child Left Behind, and the Common Application. Results matter—test results, mostly. Of course, a college education is essential, but the caliber of the school matters too. For admissions, you are measured 11 inches tall and 8.5 inches wide. To succeed, you have to pitch yourself in a certain way, conform to the idea of a perfect applicant. So we live our lives reaching for that ideal application.”

“You’re <em>restless in the pursuit of prosperity</em>—that’s natural. That drive, though, can lead toward individuality, towards opportunism, and away from society,” Putnam warned.

“Not entirely and not always. Our <em>ethos</em> of a meritocracy is essentially beneficent. If I work hard—join those clubs, write those emails, arrange those meetings—sure, I can get a better job and make a lot of money. More important, I can be a successful person. I can be a good friend and parent. I understand there’s a way I’m supposed to act—responsible and conscientious—to do well.”

“Does that mean you’ll commit yourself to public service or you’ll run for office?”

“Maybe, but I’d just as happily run an NGO as I’d manage clients for Bain,” the kid responded ambivalently. “I’ll take any avenue for success and so would my friends.”

“You don’t consider that hypocritical: you want to be good people, but everything good you do just for yourself.”

“No. We understand that personal enrichment can come through community service. We don’t need great acts of service or commitment, just daily, constant work. It’s professionalized communitarianism.”

“So resume building rightly understood? That’s some kind of democratic virtue.”

“Sure, that works. But we don’t talk like that: virtue and the like. We talk about <em>accomplishment</em>, and we accomplish a lot more for ourselves working together.”

<h3><strong>The Problems of a Civil Society Moving into the 21<sup>st</sup> Century</strong></h3>
At the turn of the century, bowling league membership was down, way down, and this, to Harvard professor Robert Putnam was quite a problem. See, with the loss of bowling leagues go the friendly conversations over beer, pizza, and pretzels and the weekly commitments that solo bowlers do without. Now, we bowl alone.  Putnam provides this meme as an entry point into his body of research on social capital, a democratic concept tracing back to the 1800s, most simply defined as the social fabric that eases collective action; it’s what helps societies come together. For Putnam, the decline of bowling leagues—along with a host of similar stories—tells of a waning of social capital and an atomization of American society. But following his research—and many unfriendly rejoinders to his conclusions—the literature has gone on to ask what makes up a group, not only what it does. How does diversity affect the formation of social capital? 

<h2>Putnam Bowls Alone</h2>
The bowling league case is one of Putnam’s more whimsical examples, an accessible illustration of the trend in his controversial essay and book, B<em>owling Alone</em>.  As political scientist focused on the background institutions that support and inform governance, he focused on the role of civil society in politics in this review of American society, because, as he writes, “The norms and networks of civic engagement also powerfully affect the performance of representative government. That, at least, was the central conclusion of my own 20-year, quasi-experimental study of subnational governments in different regions of Italy.” <a href="#_ftn8">[8]</a> His conclusion from the Italian summary was that a vibrant civil society—“networks of organized reciprocity and civic solidarity”—were a precondition for successful modern nations. Focused more on the statistical analysis, Putnam loosely tells the story of this relationship, standing on the data as proof. For Putnam, networks of civic engagement house the memories of cooperative success, which serve as a kind of template for future action. You learn how to get things done—together. Plus, the networks of interaction “broaden the participants' sense of self,” developing the “‘I’ into the ‘we’.”<a href="#_ftn9">[9]</a>

Civic life is in this way a factor of production for society, and social capital then its metric. Putnam defines social capital as the “features of social organization such as networks, norms, and social trust that facilitate coordination and cooperation for mutual benefit.” Those features and their direct effects, though, are difficult to identify—let alone quantity—but with a wealth of information on public attitudes and activities, Putnam maps certain traits to trends in social capital in contemporary America. It is an input-output study—with many variables. The inputs are the causes of social capital—associational activity, familial ties, and the like; the outputs are its effects—civic participation and societal trust.

In his analysis, social capital inputs have dropped.  Since the 1960s, Churchgoing slipped from roughly 15 percent. Since the mid-1950s, when union membership peaked, the nonagricultural union rosters have cut by more than half. The Boy Scouts are off by 26 percent since 1970, and the Red Cross off by 61. In sum, after expanding steadily throughout most of this century, many major civic organizations have experienced a sudden, substantial, and nearly simultaneous decline in membership over the last decade or two. According to Putnam, we aren’t just bowling alone, we’re living alone.

If a decline in civic activities is the input then a drop social trust is the output in Putnam’s social capital calculus. “The proportion of Americans saying that most people can be trusted fell by more than a third between 1960, when 58 percent chose that alternative, and 1993, when only 37 percent did.”<a href="#_ftn10">[10]</a> Couple that with the “loosening bonds of the family” and closed-off neighbors and according to Putnam, we see a society that is dishearteningly disconnected.

Conversely, controlling for most socioeconomic factors—race, income, education, etc—he found that with more social capital in a state, the more educated and well-off are its children, the lower the homicide rate, the greater the degree of public health, and the smaller the likelihood of tax evasion.

So what explains the overall drop? Putnam points to four possible causes of the social capital drop: 1) the movement of women into the labor force; 2) mobility; 3) demographic changes such as more divorces and fewer children; and 4) television as the new form of leisure. All these sum to a sense that American culture has changed for the worse—more demanding and less social; more atomized and less connected—and as he concludes, “there is reason to suspect that [our] democratic disarray may be linked to a broad and continuing erosion of civic engagement that began a quarter-century ago.” <a href="#_ftn11">[11]</a>

We could at this junction take up an appraisal of his claims on the decline of social capital, with the help Francis Fukayama’s conscientious primer<a href="#_ftn12">[12]</a> or Ernesto Cortez’s stirring tales<a href="#_ftn13">[13]</a>, but criticism is unnecessary when addendums are available. In 2008, Putnam published a small article titled, “The Rebirth of American Civic Life” in the midst of the presidential campaign that sketched the path of a restoration of social trust.<a href="#_ftn14">[14]</a> That path was taken up already in that election cycle, as evidenced by astronomical turnout in the beginning of that year, but for lasting progress, the continued participation of young people was critical.

<blockquote>“For most Americans the half-life of the civic boom let after the [9/11] attacks was barely six months. Within a year measures of civic engagement had returned to the previous levels, from which they have barely budged since. Except among young people. Among the cohort of Americans caught by 9/11 in their formative years, the effects of the attacks on their civic consciousness were more enduring. The annual UCLA chart of interest in politics jumped upward in 2001 for the first time in decades and has kept rising every year since.”<a href="#_ftn15">[15]</a>
</blockquote>


But the roadblock to the conversion of their fleeting interest into sustained trust was the possibility of procedural distrust—the fear that the “…the results of the caucuses and primaries [might be] overturned by unelected (though officially legitimate) superdelegates.” Putnam speculated the impact, estimating “the lesson for the young civic stalwarts would be unmistakable - democratic politics is a sham.” <a href="#_ftn16">[16]</a> Fortunately for Putnam and so his vision of American society, the votes were counted and record turnout continued into November.

Though this seems to settle the inquiry into social capital, the research has taken on different directions in recent years, away from simply its measurement towards a broader understanding: what causes it, how, and what might affect it.

Putnam has contributed into this kind of social capital research with the recent publication of an essay, “<em>E Pluribus Unum</em>: Diversity and Community in the Twenty-first Century.”<a href="#_ftn17">[17]</a> In a way, this is a sequel to <em>Bowling Alone</em>. If Bowling Alone called our attention to a problem in society, this essay explores a possible solution. It asks essentially, can diversity develop social capital? His answer comes as a surprise not only to himself but also to those who assume that diversity strengthens communities.

He took upon a similar statistical endeavor as before, controlling for socioeconomic factors—age, education, and poverty—across areas to find the relationship between diversity and social well being. And in the short run, that relationship was negative. As he explains, “The more ethnically diverse the people we live around the less we trust them.”<a href="#_ftn18">[18]</a> In terms of real impact, he found greater the diversity in a community, the fewer people vote and the less they volunteer, the less they give to charity and work on community projects. In the most diverse communities, neighbors trust one another about half as much as they do in the most homogenous settings. The study, the largest ever on civic engagement in America, found that virtually all measures of civic health are lower in more diverse settings.

This finding flies in the face of traditional theories of diversity that predicted either growth or conflict after immigration. The “contact theory” holds that increased contacts between different groups—just face-to-face contacts—will spark recognition of commonality and lead to smooth, shared relations. The “conflict theory” on the other hand takes a less rosy view of human nature, expected the groups to square off, actively. Essentially, they are two ends of the spectrum: cooperation or corrosion. Putnam’s findings fall right at the center, and lay flat. Instead of action in either direction—positive or negative—individuals faced with diversity do less. They turn inwards, less trusting of the “other” and, curiously, of their own as well. Trust across the system decreases. Putnam explains the phenomenon as a hunkering down: "People living in ethnically diverse settings appear to 'hunker down' -- that is, to pull in like a turtle.”<a href="#_ftn19">[19]</a>

This hunkering down seems to be a serious challenge for social capitalists, and Putnam, himself, recognizes this. An individual willingness to engage in society is critical for any amount of social capital to take root. A people hunkered down are just persons, not a people at all.

So then how do diverse societies function? How does the United States and Europe not only survive, but also from time to time thrive? Putnam makes way for the long-term vitality of diverse states.  Citing World War II, religious immigration, and other movements, Putnam finds that over time “successful immigrant societies create new forms of social solidarity and dampen the negative effects of diversity by constructing new, more encompassing identities.”<a href="#_ftn20">[20]</a> So in the short-run, society suffers, but in the long run it reconstructs and essentially grows.

In explaining this phenomenon, Putnam relies on a fundamental assumption about human identity -- that we are socially defined:

<blockquote>‘When social distance is small, there is a feeling of common identity, closeness, and shared experiences. But when social distance is great, people perceive and treat the other as belonging to a different category’ (Alba &amp; Nee 2003, 32). Social distance depends in turn on social identity: our sense of who we are. <strong>Identity itself is socially constructed and can be socially de-constructed and re-constructed.</strong> Indeed, this sort of social change happens all the time in any dynamic and evolving society. For example, religious evangelism, social mobilization and political campaigning all involve the intentional transformation of identities.<a href="#_ftn21">[21]</a> (emphasis mine)
</blockquote>

As the community is rewoven, then, so is our identity. What was before foreign or the other becomes common and the same. As seen before, man gives “prominence to sympathy”—to use Dewey’s terms—and the fundamental commonalities overshadow the traditional differences over time. As Putnam describes, “…adapting over time, dynamically, to immigration and diversity requires the reconstruction of social identities, not merely of the immigrants themselves (though assimilation is important), but also of the newly more diverse society as a whole (including the native born).”<a href="#_ftn22">[22]</a> Thus, the very mechanics of Dewey’s social capital rehabilitate Putnam’s diverse society—in a sense, eliminating “diversity” for the sake of social trust.

Putnam, though, maintains that “diversity” should not be eliminated so much as reconstructed. With regards to ethnic identities, societies should reduce “their social salience without eliminating their personal importance,” and “encourage permeable, syncretic, ‘hyphenated’ identities; identities that enable previously separate ethnic groups to see themselves, in part, as members of a shared group with a shared identity.” Thus, ethnicity is not scrubbed away but contextualized within a broader framework of identity—presumably including religion, nationality, and even humanity.

James Q. Wilson, the famed social scientist, on the other hand, takes issue with Putnam’s belief in this allegedly natural process of social development. In his response to “E Pluribus Unum,” Wilson first praises Putnam’s scholarly conscientiousness and integrity in publishing the unsettling short-term findings but then goes to challenge the long-term prognosis. Putnam relies on tools (the military, churches, and the like) too rare for broad scale socialization of immigrants. As he explains,

“Unfortunately... the pertinence of the military, religious, or athletic model to life in neighborhoods is very slight. In those three institutions, authority and discipline can break down native hostilities or force them underground... But what authority or discipline can anyone bring to neighborhoods?”<a href="#_ftn23">[23]</a>

To summarize his answer briefly, none. The neighborhood itself lacks the functional modes to “pull the turtle from its shell.” People are able to self-segregate within even the smallest of geographies, and, to use Wilson’s example, white multi-million dollar movie stars can live blocks away from black “Shoreline Crips and the V-13 gang.” But whenever the former sees the latter, no matter how longs it’s been, she hunkers down. “Ethnic differences are often seen as threats,” he surmises, citing that, “Even where everyone is equally poor or equally threatened by crime, people exhibit less trust if their neighborhood is ethnically diverse than if it is homogeneous.” <a href="#_ftn24">[24]</a>

Wilson makes way, though, for some of Putnam’s reconstruction in multiracial marrying. He thinks that phenomenon acts “not to preserve but to blunt ethnic identity, to the point where it may well reduce the perception of how diverse a neighborhood actually is.”  So the natural corroding of lines leaves communities seeming less diverse, if still being very different. Wilson’s arguments conclude, essentially, to a sense of moral commitment and societal bond built upon superficial characteristics. Homogeneity, for him, seems to be defined by brut luck characteristics—race, ethnicity, position, and class. He vacillates between a simply physical lens and a socio-economic one, shifting from definitions of “like us” from same colors (with his citation of Thomas Schelling’s color-based self-segregation study) to same stories (“like-minded persons: first the family, then friends and colleagues…”). <a href="#_ftn25">[25]</a>Yet he leaves no room for any discernible diversity to allow for the formation of social capital. The hunkering down impulse, for Wilson, does not pass until the lines of difference seem to fade. Men who think they are different (let alone look different) cannot work together.

But then what of <em>E Pluribus Unum</em>?  How can many make one? The modern consensus suggests that the process at best, to use Max Weber’s phrase, “a slow boring of hard boards.” But there seems to be an option left open by Wilson and alluded to be Putnam: the creation of new forms of associations in neighborhoods that impose a sense of unity and authority, while serving a need. Associations could come to be freely in neighborhoods, but unlike parks or gated communities, these would bond them together with seemingly different individuals, because of not a common background but a common goal. According to Putnam the elections of 2008 seemed to point the way, but the challenge for the literature and for politicians in this century of greater diversity, is to find new ways to make one out of many, to require associational life, to -- in a modern way -- breed self-interest rightly understood.

<h3><strong>How 1830s Political Theory Made a Come Back in the 1990s</strong></h3>
The 1990’s staged something of a political resurgence for Alexis de Tocqueville. His tome on American democracy had been a much-quoted textbook for decades, but as the nation neared the 21<sup>st</sup> century, the French aristocrat of centuries past was surprisingly popular in the bully pulpit. Leaders from both sides of the aisles laid claim to the Tocquevillian legacy. Two of his most vocal heirs illustrate his ubiquity: Republican Newt Gingrich and Democrat Bill Clinton. These students translated their reading of Tocqueville’s sense of American exceptionalism into part of their governing philosophy. Upon consideration, Clinton’s appropriation, though, seems incomplete—almost peripheral—whereas the Gingrich’s seems serious—and more foundational. Both tried to identify the greatness of America with its “goodness,” but Gingrich’s conservatism—federalist, regulatory, and openly religious—was better able to inherit the Tocquevillian democratic conception.
<h2>Tocqueville’s Democracy: Three Exceptional Causes</h2>
Tocqueville’s <em>Democracy in America</em> lends itself to political appropriation in a sense. The energetic and insightful work paints a seemingly positive view of American democracy and culture and many of his hypotheses came through, adding legitimacy to his perspective. He saw social and political democratization as a providential fact with potentially barbarous results, but he also saw American democracy <em>work</em>, preserving liberty and confounding ancient and even his own fears.  Thus, he could conclude that it could survive and even thrive thanks to its distinct character and structure, a conclusion nationalist politicians would happily appropriate. Though he warned against generalizations, pithy abstractions decorate his work, tempting American rhetoricians—and they often take the bait, quoting choice lines often without the accompanying argumentation. Thus, to gauge the fidelity of their use, we must first understand Tocqueville’s argument on American exceptionalism.

Much unlike his students, Tocqueville’s offers qualification and context at the outset, writing, “A thousand circumstances independent of the will of man facilitate the maintenance of a democratic republic in the United States.”<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a> Yet through his analysis, he discerned three essential causes that contribute to the “maintenance of the democratic republic in the United States,” <a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a> the federal form, the local, free institutions, and the rule of law.

“The first [cause for success of the American republican democracy] is that federal form of government which the Americans have adopted, and which enables the Union to combine the power of a great republic with the security of a small one.”<a href="#_ftn3"><sup><sup>[3]</sup></sup></a> Tocqueville found considerable value in the American system of federalism. In fact, he argued that this characteristic—among others—made this instance unique and capable of confounding the history of failed republics. Moreover, he even ventured that, “a great republic will always be exposed to more perils than a small one.”<a href="#_ftn4"><sup><sup>[4]</sup></sup></a> The Frenchman maintained that a large republic played host to a larger choir of impassioned men, and harking the Federalists’ line, unchecked human passion could spell demise for a republican democracy. Small states can control those passions more, but they oft suffer from weakness. Thus, he concluded, “The federal system was created with the intention of combining the different advantages which result from the magnitude and the littleness of nations.” <a href="#_ftn5">[5]</a>

A strong federal structure allows the national legislator to tend to the general needs of the nation and the state legislator the authority to satisfy his more connected neighbors. In a practical way, this assures responsive and effective governance: “The central government of each <em>state</em>, which is in immediate relationship with the citizens, is daily apprised of the wants that arise in society; and new projects are proposed every year…”<a href="#_ftn6">[6]</a> Thus—though this may have changed now—the federal government has a small, controlled sphere of influence: its actions are rare and its threat to liberty small.

Tocqueville saw another benefit to the American federal form in that it further heighten man’s ability to self-govern. With a strong and responsive state government, one could see the direct effect of one’s participation, emboldening his self-worth and self-autonomy. The unitary form, though, results in ineffective governance and removed control. Tocqueville tied local governance to the cultivation of a “<em>taste for freedom</em>,” and in America he saw this most clearly in the township institutions: “The second [cause of success for the American republican democracy] consists in those township institutions which limit the despotism of the majority and at the same time impart to the people a taste for freedom and the art of being free.” <a href="#_ftn7">[7]</a> Men who have the “art of being free” are capable of sustaining a democracy, through legitimate participation through elections, political associations, and political parties.

In Volume II, he would develop this notion—“the art of being free”—in his discussion of American mores and associational life. He saw in America a robust and energetic civil society, which was not distinct from the political realm, but essentially connected to it. As Dana Villa rightly argues in “Tocqueville in Civil Society,” the townships were a kind of associations, not unlike political or civil associations. <a href="#_ftn8">[8]</a> Each had a distinct character and effect, but together they cultivated the associational nature of American society. Tocqueville would write, “Wherever at the head of some undertaking you see the government in France, or a man of rank in England, in the United States you will be sure to find an association.”<a href="#_ftn9">[9]</a>

The forms of associations—permanent, political, and civil—have different corrective effects but share a corrective mechanism. For Tocqueville, political democracy was just one part of the broader wave of democratization; social democracy—that is the growth of man’s desire for equality of conditions—was another, with a greater effect on the people in a democracy. Though political democracy could enhance liberty, social democracy emboldened equality—a stronger and more dangerous force, according to Tocqueville:

<blockquote>“I think that democratic communities have a natural taste for freedom; left to themselves, they will seek it, cherish it, and view and privation of it with regret. But for equality their passion is ardent, insatiable, incessant, invincible; they call for equality in freedom; and if they cannot obtain that, they still call for equality in slavery. They will endure poverty, servitude, barbarism, but they will not endure aristocracy.”<a href="#_ftn10">[10]</a>
</blockquote>

This passion for equality when hosted in democratic institutions has pernicious effects: materialism, individualism, and majoritarian despotism. Man sees himself as equal to all others, which inflames his ego, turns him into his own affairs, and prepares him for <em>soft despotism</em>. Tocqueville’s fear is thus an atomized and indifferent citizenry, coddled by immense tutelary power of the state.

The art of association combats those effects, tempering individualism and socializing man. As man recognizes the singular potential of institutions, his self-interest learns to identify with group interest. For Tocqueville, this is self-interest rightly understood—that is, self-interest that is aligned with the communities interest. It is the habit generated by associational life that forces man both above himself and into public affairs. Scholar Peter Augustine Lawler identifies this as the remedy to democratic apathy that “enlarges” the heart, sustaining moral space in society. This seems to explain Tocqueville’s bold assertion that, “the principle of self-interest rightly understood appears to me the best suited of all philosophical theories to the wants of the men of our time…[and] their chief remaining security against themselves.”<a href="#_ftn11">[11]</a>

Tocqueville saw great value in the independent and strong judiciary in the United States: “The third is to be found in the constitution of the judicial power. I have shown how the courts of justice serve to repress the excesses of democracy…”<a href="#_ftn12">[12]</a> The American judicial system emphasized the rule of law, and Tocqueville observed that the people were respectful of it. Here he demonstrates how the type of politics—republican democracy—can influence the mores the people, writing, “In the United States everyone is personally interested in enforcing the obedience of the whole community to the law; for as the minority may shortly rally the majority to its principles...” <a href="#_ftn13">[13]</a> Thus, the minority demonstrates a respect for the majority and for the process. There’s an element of self-interest to it, as they hope to one day hold the majority’s position, but also, there is a certain faith in the legal process. These factors allow for peaceful politics, for the majority and minority to work together without great violence or agitation.

Tocqueville, though, pointed out the upshot of a uncompetitive democracy: “The exercise of the right of association becomes dangerous, then, in proportion as great parties find themselves wholly unable to acquire the majority.” <a href="#_ftn14">[14]</a>

Tocqueville accredits religion, in part, for American’s acceptance of the rule of law. In “Morality &amp; Politics in Modern Life,” Stephen Baron rehearses the argument well:

<blockquote>“[Religion] tightens the moral ties on mankind at exactly the moment when the political ties on it have been weakened. And just when doubt threatens to condemns him to ‘anarchy’ and ‘impotence,’ religion provides man with ‘clear, precise, intelligible… and very durable’ ideas about his existence. Religion thus imposes a ‘salutary control’ on man’s intellect, effectually limiting the ways in which he conceives of happiness… Religion ‘imposes on each man some obligations towards mankind to be performed in common with the rest of mankind.’”<a href="#_ftn15">[15]</a>
</blockquote>

Thus, religion matures man from petty insolence to learned acquiescence. Not only does it buttress the rule of law, but it also softens self-interest, in much the same way associations do. In that, Tocqueville considers religion one of democracy’s chief institutions, one deeply evident throughout American history and one aptly solidified in the Constitution.

Tocqueville thus identified three exceptional characteristics in American democracy: the federal form, the township institutions, and the peaceable judiciary. Each of these legal forms connects to deeper social phenomenon—associational life, self-interest rightly understood, and religion—which present remedies to democracy’s despotic, apathetic, and anarchic ills. His argumentation, though flawed in some places, is robust and multifaceted, a complexity, we’ll see, not often mirrored in his political heirs.
<h2>Clinton’s New Covenant</h2>
President Bill Clinton was fond of quoting Alexis de Tocqueville. The American Presidency Project lists 21 instances of direct citation, far more than the closest Democratic competitor (Carter and Kennedy with two each) and near the high standard of his predecessor, Bush senior.<a href="#_ftn16">[16]</a> He even gave Tocqueville a prime-time airing with a mention in the 1995 State of the Union:

If you go back to the beginning of this country, the great strength of America, as de Tocqueville pointed out when he came here a long time ago, has always been our ability to associate with people who were different from ourselves and to work together to find common ground. And in this day, everybody has a responsibility to do more of that. We simply cannot wait for a tornado, a fire, or a flood to behave like Americans ought to behave in dealing with one another.<a href="#_ftn17">[17]</a>

With rather imprecise terms, Clinton does seem to grasp one element of Tocqueville’s analysis: the role of associations. Perspectives distort the comparison, though. Tocqueville was stating the process he saw in America; Clinton is lamenting its lack. Thus, whereas Tocqueville explained how Americans became able to find common grounds—that is, rightly understanding self-interest—Clinton calls for that understanding immediately. . He offers the normative, “ought,” in claiming that Americans should behave in a certain way, which aligns with Tocqueville’s clear bias for healthy civil society. Nonetheless, this shift does conflate the means with the result: if associational life cultivates self-interest rightly understood, then without it, democrats would not have that capacity.

In a sense, Clinton is telling the winter to grow the flowers of spring.

To be fair, Tocqueville did allow for the deliberate cultivation of self-interest rightly understood, but in a more nuanced fashion:

<blockquote>I do not think that the system of self-interest as it is professed in America is in all its parts self- evident, but it contains a great number of truths so evident that men, if they are only educated, cannot fail to see them. Educate, then, at any rate, for the age of implicit self-sacrifice and instinctive virtues is already flitting far away from us, and the time is fast approaching when freedom, public peace, and social order itself will not be able to exist without education.<a href="#_ftn18">[18]</a>
</blockquote>

Clinton wrongly attempted exhortation when education was needed. Mores are cultivated, not demanded. He calls on Americans to show daily the same cooperation they show in response to national tragedy, and while he misses the mechanics of associational life, he does touch upon the right theme: responsibility. This theme—responsible citizenship—attends most of Clinton's Tocquevillian speeches. His appropriation of Tocqueville is thus best summarized in the theme of the earlier speech, a New Covenant:

<blockquote>We all gain when we give, and we reap what we sow. That's at the heart of this New Covenant. Responsibility, opportunity, and citizenship, more than stale chapters in some remote civic book, they're still the virtue by which we can fulfill ourselves and reach our God-given potential and be like them and also to fulfill the eternal promise of this country, the enduring dream from that first and most sacred covenant. I believe every person in this country still believes that we are created equal and given by our Creator the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.<a href="#_ftn21">[21]</a>
</blockquote>

In fact, in that passage, he comes closest to fidelity to Tocqueville’s remote civic book. The essential tension between equality and liberty is enshrined in the Declaration of Independence, and as Tocqueville recognized, without an active citizenry the prospect for liberty—already pitted in an uneven fight—seem bleak. A New Covenant to restore an energetic civil society could stall or hopefully reverse the atomization of individualism, and it could require and thus reinvigorate the art of association. Yet, liberty has and requires more allies—namely, decentralization and religion—so Clinton’s exhortations, however noble, belie Tocqueville’s broader and richer analysis.

Clinton’s omission becomes more understandable, though, when put in political context. He did triangulate—offering welfare reform, for example—but he still was the leader of the Democratic Party, who among other policies tried to implement universal healthcare as a federal guarantee. Even though Clintonian liberalism was of a moderate sort—somewhat religious too—his opposition, the Congressional GOP, held more closely to the Tocqueville’s conservative tenants: decentralization and religion.
<h2>Gingrich’s Contract With America</h2>
Political scientists, William F. Connelly Jr. and John J. Pitney Jr. situate the 1994 GOP in the historical Republican tradition:

<blockquote>“Limited government may provide the unifying theme, if the rationale make clear that: free markets are more efficient than large public bureaucracies, and bureaucratic centralization undermines self-government by supplanting community building and character building institutions: family, church, school, and voluntary associations. This core GOP message has time-honored roots in the Reagan Revolution, the Republicanism of Lincoln, and the ideas of Alexis de Tocqueville.”<a href="#_ftn22">[22]</a>
</blockquote>

Not only did their analysis explicitly point to Tocqueville, but so did the new House Speaker Newt Gingrich himself—frequently and passionately, as Scott L. McLean in <em>Social Capital</em> points out:

<blockquote>“Fresh from his 1994 victory, Speaker Newt Gingrich declared from the well of the House of that the triumphant Republicans had based their programs on Democracy in America’s celebration of voluntary action and Frederick von Hayek’s hostility to the regulatory state… Gingrich regularly quoted Tocqueville in support of the Contract With America’s frontal assault on the New Deal.”<a href="#_ftn23">[23]</a>
</blockquote>

In fact, Tocqueville too was hostile to the regulatory state both as an encroachment on the efficient market and as a precursor to soft despotism. Thus, Gingrich aligns rather squarely with the Frenchmen, as evidenced simply by his “Required Reading List.” <em>Democracy in America</em>, he maintained, was mandatory for good Americans.

Gingrich summarizes his reading of Tocqueville in a speech before the Orphan Foundation of America, saying, “America is a great country filled with good people. Tocqueville pointed out in the 1840s that volunteerism, local leadership and faith-based charities were the unique attributes that gave America its dynamic character.”<a href="#_ftn24">[24]</a> Gingrich there touches upon each of the exceptional characteristics Tocqueville’s hailed. The volunteerism connects to associational life; local leadership to decentralization; and faith-based charities to religious underpinnings. Just before that passage, he presents an argument, which further substantiates his stance as a Tocquevillian federalist. Praising a local Young Women’s Christian Association, he advocates local institutions as opposed to centralized bureaucracies, explaining, “This is not a proposal for a massive new government program. If centralized bureaucracies in Washington could have stopped drugs, guaranteed learning and ended single teen pregnancy, the job would have been done—we have created the bureaucracy and spent the money. It was just the wrong model.” <a href="#_ftn25">[25]</a> The right model, it follows, is more federal and less centralized; it’s local.

He takes up the religious underpinnings of American culture, as well, in “Defending God in the Public Square,” from his work, <em>Newt’s Five Challenges</em>.  He cites the Tocqueville’s recognition of the centrality of religion as a democratic institution—an “indispensable to the maintenance of republican institutions.” After decrying the dissenting “secular Left,” he mirrors Tocqueville’s analysis (presented by Baron above) that religion cultivates respect. He quotes Harvard professor Samuel Huntington points out that “Americans tend to have a certain catholicity toward religion: All deserve respect.”<a href="#_ftn26">[26]</a>

Soon after winning the ’94 election, Gingrich praised the character building history of American education, which is cited as a nearly explicit appropriation of Tocqueville: "there was an explicit, long-term commitment to creating character. It was the work ethic, it was honesty, right and wrong, it was not harming others, it was being vigilant in defense of liberty. It was very clear and we taught it."<a href="#_ftn27">[27]</a> America had throughout its history cultivated a Christian ethos: a learned respect for the rule of law and an ingrained sense of morality. Gingrich effectually extended Tocqueville’s argument through the arc of American history.

In “Social Citizenship and a Reconstructed Tocqueville,” Chad Alan Goldberg argues that Newt Gingrich’s New Right falsely laid claim to Tocqueville’s soul. He forcefully cites more obscure writings, which advocate for public relief and welfare, which would contradict a fervent libertarianism. In this, though, Goldberg tackles a straw man, as the New Right—as he admits—housed much cacophony, and Gingrich, himself, was somewhat pragmatic. Consider the above passage regarding centralized bureaucracies: if they could have done it, they would have.  Thus, much like Tocqueville, Gingrich’s views are based in observation and reason. Nonetheless, the point merits appreciation, though, as Tocqueville would not sit comfortably at the plank of either party.

That doesn’t mean that politicians at those ends (or anywhere in between) will stop trying to make him their own. Clinton and Gingrich did, each using Tocqueville to substantiate their general governing philosophy: Clinton’s New Covenant and Gingrich’s Contract With America. In the end, the veracity of Gingrich’s claims may be best seen by Clinton’s own actions. Pestered by the now mandated New Right federalists, the Democratic President announced to Republican glee, “The era of big government is over.”<a href="#_ftn28">[28]</a> Both the young Tocqueville of the Democracy in American and even more the Tocqueville of the <em>Ancient Regime</em> would have been happy to hear that—even without a shout out.

And this wasn’t some casual assertion: my boss knew what he was talking about. He was the political director of a national political organization, and, even before the conventions, he had recognized the harbinger of Democratic defeat. “Authenticity,” he told me, “Authenticity is what the American people want, and they don’t think Obama has it: he’s too flexible, too fake.” Regretfully, I could guess the rationale. That month, Obama had reneged on two primary promises, swallowing FISA and bucking public financing. The two moves I had read as pragmatic positioning, teeing up a well-financed and centrist general, my superior considered suicidal flip-flopping, unleashing the Rovian wolves upon John Kerry 2.0. So I applauded the pragmatism; he feared the inconsistency.

He was wrong. 365 electoral votes say so.

<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9" title="OBAMA" src="http://www.thoughts.abhinemani.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/OBAMA-300x297.png" alt="" width="300" />My boss was right, though, to recognize the tension between principle and pragmatism. A caricaturized pragmatist would seem erratic, uncontrolled, but somehow justified in any decision with the cure-all, “it’s for the best.” Well, no, it often isn’t. This is why voters appreciate some principle or ideology undergirding their politicians’ views, a sense of what they’ll do and why.&nbsp; Thus, pragmatism often earns a costly, though unfair, connotation: hollow. But that caricature overdramatizes the tension. Pragmatism <em>can be</em> infused with principle, or at least substantiated by it. This (albeit uncommon) possibility came to life in the Obama campaign. They took the Chicago-style pragmatism across the country and online, building a social movement dedicated to change but able to disagree about what it meant. By creating social capital among his supporters, he could preserve his political capital, then cashing in both for a historic win.

This story starts at home.
<h2>Chicago On My Mind</h2>
Obama moved to Chicago in 1985, a little more than a year after he graduated from Columbia University in NYC. He was 24 years old and hired to lead the Developing Communities Project (DCP), a progressive coalition aiming to mobilize black churches in the area.&nbsp; This is when he planted his roots in Chicago’s south side, and when organizing became rooted within him.

He admits as much himself, speaking to the DCP a few years ago: "I grew up to be a man, right here, in this area. It's as a consequence of working with this organization and this community that I found my calling. There was something more than making money and getting a fancy degree. The measure of my life would be public service." He found not only his calling, but also his core principles. Campaigning in Iowa, Mr. Obama called it “the best education I ever had, better than anything I got at Harvard Law School,” an education that he said was “seared into my brain.”<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a> He shares his lessons from community organizing in his chapter in a 1990 book, <em>After Alinsky: Community Organizing in Illinois</em>:
<blockquote>Organizing begins with the premise that (1) the problems facing inner-city communities do not result from a lack of effective solutions, but from a lack of power to implement these solutions; (2) that the only way for communities to build long-term power is by organizing people and money around a common vision; and (3) that a viable organization can only be achieved if a broadly based indigenous leadership — and not one or two charismatic leaders — can knit together the diverse interests of their local institutions.<a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a></blockquote>
The power of community organizing, Obama recognized, was its associative potential, the ability to construct organic, diffuse, yet powerful machines primed to change the status quo. Politically, its strength comes from numbers: “Once such a vehicle is formed, it holds the power to make politicians, agencies and corporations more responsive to community needs.”<a href="#_ftn3">[3]</a> Obama goes further in his praise, though, noting, “Equally important, it enables people to break their crippling isolation from each other, to reshape their mutual values and expectations and rediscover the possibilities of acting collaboratively — the prerequisites of any successful self-help initiative.”<a href="#_ftn4">[4]</a> By empowering a community, an organizer weaves together a thick social fabric, warming individuals’ confidence in the collective and in themselves. People learn that they each are stronger together.

Within Obama’s description is a sense of political agnosticism. He presents the potential for a community to connect and tackle a problem—any problem—without obvious preference. This too comes with the territory. The organizer’s task is not persuasion, per se—he is not collecting votes or securing praise—it is problem solving. To solve problems in Chicago, Obama evidenced his methodological pragmatism, the ability both to put community views ahead of his own and to fight for solutions. "We knew what was wrong in the community but we didn't know how to get something done about it,"<a href="#_ftn5">[5]</a> recalls Yvonne Lloyd, 78, who worked with Obama. Lloyd explains that Obama insisted on "staying in the background while he empowered us," and he encouraged residents to come up with their own priorities with the nudge: "It's your community." With his orders, he would do what was necessary, according to Michelle Obama: "Barack is not one of those people who fight for the sake of fighting. [He's] willing to do it when it's necessary," but he knows "you have to keep the door open" to deal with the other side.

This pragmatism followed him through to 2008. Recently, he explained to Steve Kroft on <em>60 Minutes </em>his method in tackling the financial crisis:
<blockquote>"What I don't want to do is get bottled up in a lot of ideology and is this conservative or liberal. My interest is finding something that works, and whether it's coming from FDR or it's coming from Ronald Reagan, if the idea is right for the times then we're going to apply it. And things that don't work we're going to get rid of."<a href="#_ftn6">[6]</a></blockquote>
Early in his career and in just a few short years, Obama had appropriated a kind of pragmatic <em>ethos</em> and, possibly unknowingly, a local tradition. Chicago’s South Side is a reformist hotbed, home to the University of Chicago.&nbsp; Its own John Dewey had championed pragmatism a century earlier, opening his very own Laboratory School just to put his ideas into action, and it’s to Dewey—not Lincoln, Rawls, or FDR—that Obama owes his ideological debt.
<h2>A Legacy of Pragmatism</h2>
Dewey connects pragmatism to principle. He adds philosophical weight to the simplified slogan, “it’s for the best.” He does this by recasting the meanings of ideas and the individuals.

As always the products of inquiry, ideas are bound up in the problematic situation that produced them. Simply put, ideas are a way of scratching an itch. And they only have value, then, if we actually use them.&nbsp;When faced with a problem, rational inquiry upon termination presents ideas, and Dewey claims, to make inquiry meaningful we much use those ideas to alleviate the problem. Thus, grand theories are not timeless or static; they are pliable instruments for achieving a purpose and after, should be discarded as expired. Philosophy, for Dewey, has a practical and progressive bend.

What progress, one asks? The melioration of individuality, socially, not liberally, understood. Liberals are narrow-minded, Dewey held, as they consider the individual “fixed, given ready-made.” When instead, they should know that “It is something achieved, and achieved not in isolation but with the aid and support of conditions, cultural and physical…”<a href="#_ftn7">[7]</a> Social problems—poverty, healthcare, or strife—inhibit an individual’s capacity to fully engage in society and in turn stunt the development of his individuality. By recognizing man’s social nature, you can tap into the strongest force to realize his individuality and to enact change: social capital.

Dewey pioneered the term “social capital,” but the concept dates back further, most notably to Alexis de Tocqueville. The famed democratic observer detected a humanitarian impulse in American democracy. This impulse presses for liberty through associational life. Man comes together in low-level democracy—the grassroots—recognizes the commonality between himself and another, and learns to trust him, if for no other reason than he must. Or else, democracy would stall, and problems persist. This recognition underpins self-interest rightly understood, and its prevalence in 1830s America fueled a rich and productive civic life. It was social capital at work.

Dewey elaborates this concept and connects it back to pragmatism. In “Social Capital: A Conceptual History,”<a href="#_ftn8">[8]</a> James Farr presents Dewey’s three key connections. First, “we leverage one part of reality against the other.” Since ideas are instrumental and men social, we should use cooperative action to solve the problems that brought the ideas into existence. Second, pragmatism gives “prominence to sympathy.” Following Tocqueville’s impulse, Dewey’s sympathy is the product of deliberation and is “cultivated imagination for what men have in common and a rebellion at whatever unnecessarily divides them.” It makes possible social life. Third, social capital can be conceived as a commodity. It can be employed or squandered just like funds or property. But it is the community’s good, so there is political justification in its investment and development.

To be fair, Dewey’s pragmatism is coarse. No grand ideas, no first principles, no five point plans, just two basic concepts. Ideas have limits, and society has power. With the recognition of both—and their underlying epistemology—comes the acceptance of a philosophical and political burden: progress. The pragmatist, free of ideological fetters, can and must leverage social capital to surmount challenges great and small.

Consciously or subconsciously, Obama inherited this philosophical tradition, and his campaign’s success testifies to its veracity.
<h2>The Social Capital Campaign</h2>
Can it get much harder to win the presidency? You’re black, your middle name is Hussein, you have little experience, and you’re up against the two most powerful political organizations in modern history: the Clintons and the Republicans. This is not an ideal candidacy; nor is it an easy one.

To grapple with seemingly insurmountable odds, Obama returned to his organizer roots. He flipped the top-down style Clintonian campaign on its head and generated enthusiasm from the bottom up. From the outset, he recognized that social capital would have to pay for his electoral victory. In his announcement speech, he said,

This campaign must be the occasion, the vehicle, of your hopes, and your dreams. It will take your time, your energy, and your advice - to push us forward when we're doing right, and to let us know when we're not. This campaign has to be about reclaiming the meaning of citizenship, restoring our sense of common purpose, and realizing that few obstacles can withstand the power of millions of voices calling for change.<a href="#_ftn9">[9]</a>

His overtures, though noble, would not be enough alone. Remember, for Dewey, society could develop more capital through education and capitalize upon it with social movements. But Professor Obama couldn’t teach a national civics course, and a campaign for the presidency isn’t exactly a social movement. Using social capital for purely political ends seems difficult.

This, in fact, is a classic problem for political parties imitating social movements. In his study of political reform clubs in New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles in the 1950s and early 1960s, James Q. Wilson recounted what one Los Angeles leader told him: The club movement is not basically a social movement...My social friends are not in the clubs. I don’t go to the homes of the people I know in the clubs and they don’t come to mine. Club meetings, Wilson argued, were “long and often dull in the extreme, with a seemingly endless agenda and interminable speakers.”<a href="#_ftn10">[10]</a>

Thus, a candidate has two problems in building a social movement. First, people don’t care that much. Second, politics isn’t very social. This former is essentially a question of size: how can the candidate enlarge his campaign into something bigger than himself? The latter is one of methods: how can you bring people together in meaningful ways?

The Obama campaign had answers to both.
<h2>Change.org(anization)</h2>
In equal parts opportunism and pragmatism, Obama enshrined “change” as this campaign theme. He promised to “bring change to Washington” and to&nbsp; “change the way Washington worked,” and these promises betrayed and rationalized his relative inexperience. He may be young, but he’s new and different. With Congressional and Presidential approval rating beneath 40 percent or lower, those characteristics would attract disappointed voters. Furthermore, his more polished slogan, “Change we can believe in," surfaced in late 2007, with the less-than-subtle implication that the promises of change coming from establishment choice, Clinton, can't be trusted. In the campaign, change could work for him.

In another way, “change we can believe in” encapsulates a kind of pragmatic philosophy. It is defined by the circumstance and promises solutions to pressing problems. Without policy elaboration, the slogan would attract interest from anyone disappointed or underserved by the status quo. This broadened his appeal, an appeal deepened by his patriotic infusion: “The genius of our founders is that they designed a system of government that can be changed. And we should take heart, because we've changed this country before.”<a href="#_ftn11">[11]</a> Change was possible, he claimed, and everyone’s American duty to realize it. Essentially, he crafted his campaign’s message as an agnostic creed for the American spirit.

Coupled with soaring rhetoric from a diverse and likeable candidate, the message caught on.&nbsp; Obama himself recalled months into the race, “We started this campaign talking about change. We talked about it while we were down, and we talked about it while we were up. Now almost everybody is talking about change."<a href="#_ftn12">[12]</a> Commentators would agree that the 2008 presidential was a “Change election.”<a href="#_ftn13">[13]</a> Billing himself as the best “agent of change,” Obama was able to enlarge his campaign into a broader movement. His posters read “Change” not “Obama,” his podium had “Change” plastered in front, he owned “Change.org,” and even his events were Change-themed (consider the low-dollar fundraiser, “Small Change for Big Change”). Whenever possible, Obama’s campaign <em>would not</em> be about him.

But a campaign is won by its moving parts, not by its design. Even with broader and deeper appeal, the movement would still need to be social. The engine of social movements is social capital, a commodity enriched and employed by meaningful cooperation. Put another way, he still needed to organize his community and put it to work.
<h2>My.BarackObama .com</h2>
As a community organizer, Obama himself would arrange and host meetings in his Chicago neighborhood. Even with a small and set demographic, mobilization and participation was difficult. Locals asked, <em>Who is this guy</em>? And distrust often led to inaction. Now multiply this problem a million times over and stretch it across a continent. This was the challenge facing the Obama campaign in 2007. The candidate was relatively unknown (or, even worse, misunderstood), and they needed victories in primaries and caucuses across the country. Darkening this organizational nightmare was the problem of financing. Commissioning former DNC chair Terry McCauffe, Clinton commanded the party coffers. Obama would have to reach out to and rely upon new donors to finance his insurgency.

Traditional organizing, then, was not an option, too difficult and too costly. Instead, the campaign upgraded the concept. They “crowdsourced” campaigning.

Meet MyBO.

My.BarackObama.com (or My.BO) was the campaign’s digital headquarters, open to everyone, 24/7. Upon registering, you were tasked with community building responsibilities. Your page included a scale of your involvement (1 to 10), and each “action” bumped you up. You were your own campaign manager. For finances, you could plan and host fundraisers, set personal and group targets, and watch your contribution thermometer rise. For fieldwork, you could make an online group, plan local activist events, and even download voter contact information, volunteering your cell phone as a mini-phone bank.

In a way, the Obama campaign stole its methodology from Napster. Online file-sharing platforms first popularized the notion of peer-to-peer (P2P) interaction. Instead of millions of users accessing data from one central database, the data is distributed among the users, and they connect with each other. It’s a network, not a silo. In file sharing, the advantage is speed; in politics, it’s power.

The power comes from diversity and flexibility. Each node has its own character and its own leadership, and each is able to respond to the needs in its locations. The distributed structure requires low-level activism, which in turn, creates low-level activists. As the campaign advances and gains experience, those activists become skilled, and accordingly, the campaign grows. The nature of the growth is more important: it’s personal. The campaign can infiltrate a social group with just one contact and then leverage that contact for access to the entire group. It’s viral campaigning. By getting to just one of your friends, they’ll inevitably get to you via email, phone, or invitation to your friend’s <em>Party for Change</em>. Since each group could be a hotbed of interactivity and participation, trust and enthusiasm developed. Thus, each person had the capacity to develop the campaign’s social capital. For the campaign, this meant more volunteers, more dedication, and more money. In turn, there was more confidence among the membership. The crowdsourced campaign was thus organic, dynamic, and expansive.

The Obama campaign championed this P2P approach, employing new-media tools to craft a user-generated campaign. “One of my fundamental beliefs from my days as a community organizer is that real change comes from the bottom up,” Mr. Obama said in a statement. “And there’s no more powerful tool for grass-roots organizing than the Internet.” This was a lesson Democrats learned from the short-lived Dean campaign. The 2004 Dean campaign broke ground with its online meeting technologies and blogging, but the country just wasn’t ready yet, according to Lawrence Lessig, a Stanford law professor specializing on Internet policy advice, in <em>Technology Review</em>. Times have changed though, he continues, "The world has now caught up with the technology." The Obama campaign recognized this early, he says: "The key networking advance in the Obama field operation was really deploying community-building tools in a smart way from the very beginning."

And what smarter way than facebook’s? The social network connects tens of millions of people across the world, and on college campuses, serves as the community portal. The campaign decided not only to follow suit, but also to snatch the ace. Obama hired Chris Hughes, co-founder of facebook, to run online operations, and he explained his strategy, paraphrased by the <em>New York Times</em>:
<blockquote>Hughes brought a growth strategy, borrowed from Facebook’s founding principles: keep it real, and keep it local. Mr. Hughes wanted Mr. Obama’s social network to mirror the off-line world the same way that Facebook seeks to, because supporters would foster more meaningful connections by attending neighborhood meetings and calling on people who were part of their daily lives. The Internet served as the connective tissue.<a href="#_ftn14">[14]</a></blockquote>
The My.BO network strung together diverse and distant groups into a cohesive social network. The network, then, could capitalize upon turbocharged activist resources for meaningful impact.

That network, though, sometimes strained. “Change” housed a large coalition, and Obama had trouble serving all his masters. My.BO helped smooth tensions. When dissent did spring up, it was compartmentalized online—within one group or on one page—so the campaign could sustain its momentum while allowing disagreement. Moreover, this sense of openness and deliberation could enrich the sense of membership. Blog posts were open to comments, and the campaign sometimes responded to users’ questions. Obama himself posted a long explanation of his FISA vote to temper his angry “netroots.”

No community is without its disagreements, and as Tocqueville pointed out, the virtue of associations is that they teach us to compromise for the greater good. In this way, My.BO was a digital free association. In the end, groups would retire their complaints for the larger cause. Thus, Obama was free to make pragmatic political moves, such as that FISA vote, without sacrificing his campaign’s core. Social capital thus produced political capital.
<h2>Cashing in the Capital</h2>
The two-year campaign really came down to 12 hours: 7am to 7pm, November 4th. Get Out The Vote (GOTV) strategies are how elections are won (ask Karl Rove), since no amount of voter participation is as crucial as casting a ballot. This is where the social capital was cashed in. The campaign had been prepping activists across the country for months in basic GOTV strategies—phone banking, door-to-door, and text messaging—and this was the opportunity to let them loose. Armed with pinpointed data from My.BO, these self-made foot soldiers could score big in previously unattended communities. It’s impossible to know the direct impact of the ground game, since the campaign has not released contact totals. Nonetheless, historic turnout (over 65 percent) and Obama victories in perennial Republican strongholds (Colorado, Omaha, and Florida to name a few) suggest the troops mattered—in a big way.
<h2>Social Capital 2.0</h2>
The Obama campaign thus enshrined pragmatism as its message and its methodology.&nbsp; In a way, it solved its own problems. To create a social movement, they latched onto an attractive and timely theme, and to power it, they strapped it onto an explosive online network. Its success illustrates the sustainability and power of social capital in the modern age. The Internet, at times atomizing, can knit together diffuse networks of meaningful interaction. While not a substitute, these networks can complement or even produce real-world communities, and together, they can facilitate deliberation, generate trust, and motivate action. Put another way, they can <em>yield social capital</em>. Then, leveraging it is the work of pragmatic organizers.

Moving forward, the lesson of the Obama campaign is at once old and new: to make one out of many, each of the many must feel like one.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[There’s a common and visceral response in foreign policy; it’s the gag reflex that replaces engagement with nativism, activism with pacifism. We saw this in the wake of World War I and Vietnam, and now, the Iraq debacle may trigger another. Tired of this misguided and mismanaged war, the United States may again capitulate to isolationism at the end of President Bush’s term. Progressives now seem poised to trumpet victory on the graves of Bush Doctrine and the neoconservative tradition, and withdrawal seems to be the favorite (and only) rejoinder. But contrarianism is not a foreign policy, and isolationism is a bad one. We shouldn’t simply walk away from the neocons, but walk over them, continuing down the path to human freedom, but leaving behind the disruptive vestigials of unilateralism.
Moving ahead first demands proper appreciation. However tragic the effects of the Bush Doctrine, it had serious philosophical and historical grounding.

It was born, understandably, in the wake of 9/11. As President George W. Bush explained, the United States would not only defend against terrorists but also root out the state sponsors who aided and abetted them. This formed the logic of the first half of the Bush Doctrine, which led to the ousting of the Taliban in Afghanistan. National security, though, is a common impetus. The full Bush Doctrine—that is, the neoconservative agenda—goes further: “freedom and fear are at war.” In that, Bush accrediting the security threat to the ideologies that fostered fear. But when your enemy isn’t merely a population, but an emotion, the fight would take on multiple fronts. Enter the War in Iraq and Middle East democratization. Bush justified his ambition with faith in history: “History also has a visible direction,” he waxed in his second inaugural address. The promotion of freedom was not merely a moral imperative but a historical inevitability. Years before, Truman warned against turning a “deaf ear” to withering democracies, and Bush restated the U.S. goal to “help others find their own voice, attain their own freedom, and make their own way.” If they weren’t asking, according to Bush, they just didn’t know how to vocalize it yet. The Bush Doctrine would teach them, confident that freedom was their desire and the “longing of the soul.” So if history had a direction, Bush would add speed and magnitude.

With this insistence on both preemption and presumption, Bush overstepped. Preemption lacks legal legitimacy, and we lack the military means. International backlash demonstrates the former and military depletion the latter. Moreover, Iraq has yet to warm to democracy, so successful democratization may require more than longing souls and distant voices. In Iraq, neoconservatives miscalculated both our power and others’ potential.

Moving forward, though, progressives should not disregard this neoconservative legacy. That would be to abandon our own historical tradition.

Remember that Truman preached, “God has created us and brought us to our present position of power and strength for some great purpose.” FDR had his Four Freedoms. Even Kennedy let every nation know “that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe, in order to assure the survival and the success of liberty.” In fact, they matched rhetoric with policy: Wilson took us into World War I and then strived to build a League of Nations. FDR responded to the Old World’s call for assistance and then championed the U.N. Kennedy followed up the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan with the Peace Corps and the (albeit short-lived) Alliance for Progress.

Moral imperatives and freedom promotion have been in the progressive vocabulary for quite some time. In fact, they typify the progressive ideology, an ideology that strives to alleviate human suffering, construct structures of peace, and share the burden thereafter.  Internationally and even domestically, it’s an ideology that emphasizes the role of institutions in realizing and maintaining progress.
In that, progressivism seems to share a philosophical tradition with neoconservatism. Both lay claim to the American creed, defending human dignity and trumpeting American exceptionalism. More interestingly, both seem to share an appreciation for government. Leading neocon, Peter Berkowitz conceded, “[Neoconservativism] recognizes that government, while often part of the problem, can also be part of the solution…” A progressive wouldn’t disagree. But neoconservatives misinterpreted that principle. They employed the wrong institution.

Historically, progressives emphasized the role of international institutions and alliances in foreign policy, accepting the limits of U.S. influence and respecting the sovereignty of others. Neoconservatives hijacked this history. They derided the efficacy of the U.N., intensified security concerns, and emboldened the moral imperative. Thus, when the international community balked, they resorted to unilateralism. They expected that the U.S. government could be the solution to the world’s problems. Iraq, though, taught them the pitfalls of hubris.
The United States cannot be the only solution to the world’s problems. But, as we’ve seen in the past, we can be part of it, and even the leader. Ambition, though, must be channeled and tempered through legitimate institutions, and, there, civility is always a virtue. So is patience. Going forward, progressives and (neo)conservatives would do well to remember both.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I woke up around 2pm yesterday. No problem –- it’s summer, right? But I flipped up my laptop’s screen and noticed my lazy morning had caused serious problems for someone (let’s call him “Overeager Colleague”).&nbsp;Two emails were awaiting me in my inbox, both referring to the same, rather trivial problem, which incidentally wasn’t delaying anyone from doing anything and could easily be handled as soon as I put my contacts in. Before I could, though, a little box flashes up in the corner of my email and the title bar read, “Overeager Colleague Says…”<a href="#1">*</a>
<blockquote>Overeager Colleague: Abhi, are you there?
I need something taken care of.
I think you just came online–<em>did you just wake up?</em>–I see the green light on.</blockquote>
<em>Damn you, green light.</em>

I proceeded to put up a quick “out the door” status message on my gchat, responded to his email, and then found freedom in just two clicks (take that MLK): “Videos and More –&nbsp;<strong>Blocked</strong>.” Try it some time, emancipation feels good.

Of course, I’ll still have to deal with his nagging emails and too frequent text messages, but I hope today’s unsubtle intervention teaches him the golden rule of online communication: Chat Friends, Email Work, Phone Family.

Yes, switching to Gmail for CMC has given us many great things–threaded messaging and document sharing, for example–and most additions are unequivocal goods, especially the undo feature in the @gmail version saving me one or two dumb reply-alls. Chat, though, is a contentious addition, and you know why: the Overeager Colleague is a common plight. Plus, there are the stilted convos with random “friends” (read: unwanted acquaintances) and the awkward “How’s it going” from old flings. On the whole, email chat seems to bring social dangers of TNC together with the professional hassles of open cubicles right into your online home, your inbox. Of course, it has its virtues. One-click video chat beats out Skype for ease and speed, helping sustain long-distance relationships, and group chats make picking dining halls for dinner or movies for a night out relatively painless. Notice the common denominator in those interactions though: they are with people you want to see, people to talk to, your friends.

There’s an appeal sure, to using chat for those other things, since it’s by definition quick and faceless. But unlike elevator conversations or quick stops by the office, chat doesn’t have an escape valve. You can’t just casually walk away to get a drink (“brb” implies you’ll be back) or pick up another call (they know you can have multiple windows open).<a href="#2">**</a> No, you’re there chatting, indefinitely. And that’s great for friends–I know it’s helped me battle through a number of all-nighters with fellow brothers-in-arms–and that’s what it should be, a tool not meant to annoy or to coerce, but meant to make life easier and more fun. A way to talk with friends. A way, well, to&nbsp;<em>chat</em>.

But random acquaintances and overeager colleagues take heart, there is always email. Just please let me chat (and sleep) in peace.

<hr /><a name="1"></a>*&nbsp;I actually changed his name in my contacts–you can do that and have Google make fun of people. For example, rename TNC’s mistake and enjoy, “<em>Bad Life Decision</em> is Currently Unavailable” or “<em>99 Problems But a Bitch</em> Is Away” But maybe I just have too much free time.

<a name="2"></a>**&nbsp;And to those of you who would say “just go invisible,” blocking yourself from everybody and choosing who you bless with your presence, I say, get over yourself. That’s basically making a two-way street run one direction for your own benefit. That’s not going to get us anywhere.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I was from the very beginning willing to give Code for America my 20 percent, be it my 81st or my 119th. And then some. I was interested in the program from just the first mention, and once I met Jen, I was committed. And this past summer -- working with the team, building the organization, and seeing the impact of our work -- has bordered on surreal; it's been more than I could have imagined. 

See in my life, I've usually felt as if I came to the party a few minutes too late, as if the good ol' days were really the best days: college used be to easier, work simpler, and money freer. "The Masters of the Universe have left..." says Tom Wolfe, and I tended to agree that the era of assumed success was over. Now we'd have to earn it. So I've tried to work -- jealously maybe -- at various institutions to reclaim that legacy of optimism and accomplishment, feeling all the while like I had missed out. My timing was just off.

For the first time in my life, however, things feel different.

Why? Code for America is the perfect storm. It's the right idea with the right people at the right time. The web is changing the way we live, work, and interact with each other, and organizations are able to do more with less -- with a little help from forward thinking geeks. Code for America's beautiful little idea is that government can do the same, all we need to do is get some of those geeks into City Hall. When I learned that little idea was coming to life in a big way, I had to get involved.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A tweet got me thinking.

While in the thick of fellow recruitment for Code for America's inaugural program, we were reviewing the social traction we were receiving, and one tweet in particular caught my eye: "Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can code for your country". The messaging was striking: it blended together patriotism, service, and tech -- CfA's formula -- by playing on a piece of American history. This, I figured, was a model we could employ:

		<title>A New Kind of Public Service</title>
		<link>http://www.abhinemani.com/2011/01/06/a-new-kind-of-public-service/</link>
		<pubDate>Thu, 06 Jan 2011 12:47:21 +0000</pubDate>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>(Note: This article originally ran on <a href="http://opensource.com/government/10/12/code-america-new-kind-public-service">OpenSource.com</a> on January 3, 2011.)</em>

Government can be seen as an answer to the often messy question of collective action. There are some things people need together, but since that’s not easy to coordinate, we set up institutions to do so. Over time, the government’s focus and expectations developed -- understandably -- to a place where it was seen less as a coordinator and more as a service provider. This is what <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/blog/main/archives/2009/08/government_as_a.html">some</a> call the vending machine model of government. My tax dollars in, a safe and well-kept community out.

But, as we’re all seeing now, that machine is profoundly broken. Buckling under the weight of the budget crisis and burdened with ever-increasing demands from its citizens, governments are unable to provide those services we’ve come to expect. The federal <a href="http://www.brillig.com/debt_clock/">debt</a> is in the trillions, many cities and states <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2010/05/28/news/economy/american_cities_broke.fortune/index.htm">are</a><a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fmoney.cnn.com%2F2010%2F05%2F28%2Fnews%2Feconomy%2Famerican_cities_broke.fortune%2Findex.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNG-J6tlIeEOkc9IeaHxWT4cAg1LCA"> </a><a href="http://money.cnn.com/2010/05/28/news/economy/american_cities_broke.fortune/index.htm">nearing</a> bankruptcy, and some already <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/08/us/08bankrupt.html">have</a>. And so this analogy needs to change. Government can’t be a vending machine any longer; it must be a building block, something we use together to create the communities we hope to live in.

While this all may sound airy and abstract, in a real way, this already happening, just not as much in governance. Open source projects have captured this spirit: you build together, developing solutions for yourself and for the common good. Think of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub">GitHub</a> as an example. As an institution, it’s merely a platform for collaboration and development. It provides the tools, ranging from version control to hosting, that allow people to come together to build. And when they do, each is rewarded with not only the satisfaction of contribution, but also its public recognition. You help yourself while you help your peers, and along the way, you create value for the entire community by providing a useful service.

This is the model we at Code for America hope to enshrine in government, open sourcing not just its software, but its mechanics. We want to redefine the role of the citizens for a 21st century democracy, where they are working hand-in-hand with government to make it better. To do so, we must breakdown the barriers to entry and create new and easy ways to get involved. And that’s exactly what we’re trying to do with the <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/fellows/">CfA Fellowship program</a>. We are developing a new kind of public service.

Inspired in part by Teach for America, the Code for America fellowship recruits the brightest minds of the web industry into public service to use their skills to solve core problems facing our communities. Through our one-year fellowship program, talented web developers, designers, and entrepreneurs leverage the power of the Internet to make governments more open and efficient. Right now, interest in both technology and civic issues is peaking, and a generation of young people are eagerly looking for ways to give back. We are building our fellowship program to give these emerging leaders a path into government and public service.

Our current focus is on <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/cities">cities</a>, and partnering cities apply through a <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/city-expectations/">competitive process</a> by describing a problem space for our fellows to tackle. Throughout the year, the cities and our fellows work together, along with a team of industry leaders and thinkers, researching, brainstorming, and even co-developing the solution. But the projects are only part of our goal; we’re also developing leaders. We couple the project development with professional development, networking, and mentoring, so the fellows are not only civic-minded but also successful after the fellowship.

For our inaugural 2011 program, we’re working with <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/boston/">Boston</a>, <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>, <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/seattle/">Seattle</a>, and <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/dc/">Washington</a>. To take on these projects, we chose <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/2011-code-for-america-fellows/">20 fellows</a> out of our impressive applicant pool of more than 360 to come on board in in January. But those fellows are only a small fraction of the team we’ll need to succeed in the year and more broadly.

<strong>How can you help?</strong>

<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/cfa-labs?pli=1">Join CfA Labs Volunteer Corp</a>: To help on our 2011 projects and a host of other issues we’re seeing in cities, we're recruiting coders and designers who want to volunteer, but don't have a year to give. There is a lot of work to do, and we can use any support you've able to give. Join the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/cfa-labs?pli=1">discussion group</a>.

<a href="http://codeforamerica.org/cities/citizen-action-center/">Get Your City to Code for America</a>: We just opened up the application process for our 2012 City Program, and we are actively seeking local governments who want to engage with our fellowship program. City representatives can <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/cities/interested-city/">begin the application process online</a>, and for everyone else, we've also put together some tools to get their attention and make some noise in our <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/cities/citizen-action-center/">Citizen Action Center</a>.

Get involved however you can. Together, we can code the next chapter of American history.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>The Constitution Beyond Originalism</title>

<h3><strong>Identifying the Deep Value in Constitutional Rights</strong></h3>
Is the text enough? Common textual approaches to constitutional interpretation prioritize the text of the constitution, assuming the legitimacy of that approach. Justice Antonin Scalia expounds—quite vigorously in fact—his brand of textual originalism, but careful analysis and exploration reveals substantial issues with his account, and Professor Ronald Dworkin does not fair much better. Neither fully incorporates a sound theory of democracy in their constitutional theory. Professor Corey Brettschneider’s value theory, though incomplete, begins from the ground up and offers an attractive conception of democracy and a promising system of judicial review.

We will start by laying out Scalia’s theory of constitutional interpretation, which, when put in the light of Dworkin’s critique, will seem inadequate. Their debate though centers on the text itself, but, as we will see, there are deeper issues as well. Textualism demands philosophical grounding, and both attempt to fix theirs in a theory of democracy. Both fail. Scalia’s procedural account and Dworkin’s epistemic offer incomplete and unattractive theories of democracy, and as these theories underpin their jurisprudence, we can dismiss those as well. In the end, we’ll move past interpreting the text for the text’s sake—or even for equality’s sake—but for the sake of democracy, properly understood, and we will no longer be stuck in the moral world of the 18th century, but free to follow our own moral compass—magnetized by deliberation and consensus—towards a better realization of our most common democratic belief, the right to self-rule.
<h3>SCALIA’S JURISPRUDENCE</h3>
Let's begin first by exploring the nature of Scalia's jurisprudence and continuing to unpack its deeper philosophical underpinnings. We will see that his account in inconsistent and lacking.

Justice Scalia has vigorously pursued a textualist jurisprudence. The text is paramount, and to understand the text, the jurist must use the judicial tradition and canon when confronted with an ambiguity. In the realm of statutory interpretation, the jurist has the full body of judicial precedent; in constitutional interpretation the issues goes more complex. Scalia turns to the specific legal tradition flowing from that text -- to "what it meant to the society that adopted it." He states that this does not mean interpretation demands gleaning intent; instead, he chastises the search for intent, as it employs the common law mentality of American judges to overrun the need for textual interpretation. Textual originalism, however, requires an appreciation of the meaning of a text, not its intent.

The distinction between meaning and intent is key here. To get at the intent is to get at the idea in the scribe's mind; to get at the meaning is to get at the context and understanding of the time. For the latter, the justice must play the historian, specifically with regards to constitutional interpretation, and attempt to understand what a word would have meant at that time to the population. Scalia explains the process, explaining the apparent contradiction of reading the founding documents:
<blockquote>"I will consult the writings of some men who happened to be delegates to the Constitutional Convention—Hamilton's and Madison's writings in The Federalists, for example. I do so, however, not because they were Framers and therefore their intent is authoritative and must be the law; but rather because their writings, like those of other intelligent and informed people of the time, display how the text of the Constitution was originally understood... What I look for in the Constitution is precisely what I look for in a statute: the original meaning of the text, not what the original draftsmen intended." (Scalia, <em>A Matter of Interpretation</em>, 38)</blockquote>
Thus, the historical background would contextualize the text, hopefully providing substantive meaning to the language. To be fair, there may be disagreement among originalists—different histories, different contexts—but the discussions are centered on the meaning, not the intent.

Scalia quickly and forcefully notes, though, that this process grounds the meaning of the text in the original time. The meaning of the Constitution now is the meaning of the constitution when ratified. Consider the controversial eighth amendment to the constitution for illustration. It reads, "Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted." After reading, one is left to ask, "what is a cruel and unusual punishment?" Scalia is too, but he knows where to look. He would dive into the historical record, searching for what were cruel and unusual punishments and what the principled grounds for them were when the amendment was ratified. That information would then be abstracted to form the moral sense of that time, which would then be applied to the current. In this, he does not deny the concept that the terms "cruel and unusual" are abstract, moral principles—morality, indeed, is quite abstract—but he time dates these principles, locking them into the founding era. At least for interpretation, that is. He recognizes that these principles may change, that society may progress, but the text does not. He cites the example of capital punishment, an arguably unusual punishment in our time, but as it was widely used in 1791, the death penalty would pass constitutional muster for a textual originalist. When the people ratified the amendment in 1791, <em>their </em>democratic action legitimated its force and thus <em>their </em>moral sentiments underpin the text.

Paramount in Scalia's account is the primacy of the rule of law: the law, once democratically enacted, should be respected. This is what he calls "democratic formalism" or what another could call democratic proceduralism. "Of all the criticisms leveled against textualism, the most mindless is that it is 'formalistic.' The answer to that is, of course it's formalistic! The rule of law is about form.... Long live formalism. It is what makes a government a government of laws and not of men." In the judicial realm, formalism means rules and procedures in interpretation, not common-law positivism. He warns against the common-law judge’s, or living constitution judge’s, often arbitrary and possibly biased interpretation: that is rule by men, and according to Scalia, that is not compatible with our <em>system of government</em>. He uses that argument then against loosening the constitution’s abstract principles, as that would free the judges to unguided interpretation and, in effect, judicial law-making, which lack democratic legitimacy. <em>That </em>claim, though, requires substantiation, and, furthermore, whatever values we find in his textualism must be greater than the values we find in alternative approaches.
<h3>DWORKIN’S CHALLENGE</h3>
Let’s begin by examining the argument for and against time dated abstract principles and then continue to consider the democratic legitimacy of Scalia’s jurisprudence.

Legal scholar Ronald Dworkin takes up the issue of time dated principles with Scalia. In his <em>Justice in Robes</em>, Dworkin not only rejects Scalia’s account, but also continues to advance a fidelity system of interpretation.

Dworkin begins by introducing a distinction of semantic intent, “which takes what the legislators meant collectively to say as decisive of the constitution,” and expectation intent, “which makes decisive what they expected to accomplish in saying what they did.”5 He places Scalia’s account of statutory interpretation comfortably in the former, and Scalia himself places his constitutional jurisprudence in the former as well. Dworkin does not let him so quickly. He contends that Scalia in adding in the time restrictions on the abstract moral principles is reading into the constitution new text.
<blockquote>“I said that if Scalia were a true semantic originalist, he would be assuming, in that argument, something that seems very odd: that the framers intended to say, by using the words “cruel and unusual,” that punishments generally thought cruel at the time they spoke were to be prohibited—that is, that they would have expressed themselves more clearly if they had used the phrase “punishments widely regarded as cruel and unusual at the date of this enactment” in place of the misleading language they actually used.”</blockquote>
Under this analysis, a text free of time dating qualifications cannot be interpreted to include time dating. Thus, the relevant question is not, “what was cruel and unusual in 1791,” but rather, “what is cruel and unusual.” Dworkin explains, judges must then, “sometimes ask themselves whether punishments the framers would not themselves have considered cruel—capital punishment, for example—nevertheless are cruel, and whether discriminations the framers themselves thought consistent with equal citizenship—school segregation, for example—are nevertheless a denial of equal protection of the laws.” Moral philosophy creeps into constitutional jurisprudence, and the robe must at once cover a judge and philosopher.

Oddly, Scalia fears those dual roles. He seems overly modest in accepting the role as historian over philosopher. Nonetheless, he substantiates his disagreement with Dworkin on three (fairly philosophical) grounds. He accepts Dworkin’s semantic and expectation intent distinction, but he argues that his time-dated understanding of the Bill of Rights is consistent with semantic intent. First, he argues that contextualizing the abstract language with the less abstract, more concretely “time-dated” language produces a time-dated Bill of Rights via the canon of construction “noscitur ex sociies” (a word is known by its companions). Second, again through contextualization, the Bill of Rights is seen to secure certain rights, and the passage of time cannot alter those rights. Third and finally, if we assume the original expectation of judicial review, then the Bill of Rights would, in context, be time dated as they would be applied immediately by the judiciary. Moreover, Scalia adds that the judiciary would not logically be the best home to the moral debate incumbent on Dworkin’s (and Tribe’s) approach.

As for the first charge, Scalia clearly overreaches. He employs the legal canon, “noscitur ex sociies,” which means simply that a word is know by its companions. This is commonly used to explain an ambiguity in a particular statute but contextualizing it with the neighboring language. Scalia argues that the concrete and specific nature of some amendments (e.g. the barring of quartering of soldiers) should carry over to the more abstract ones (namely, the first amendment), limiting their scope. First, clearly this argument, though, does not make the amendments time dated. Second, the fact that some amendments use precise language and other are more general is notable, in and of itself; this does not necessarily mean “scriber’s error,” nor does it justify the contextualization with the surrounding amendments. Finally, that legal axiom generally applies to language in a particular statute, but as each amendment stands alone in the first place, it may not even apply.

The second point Scalia raises regards the content of rights. In this, however, he misses the crux of Dworkin’s argument: the text does not specify the contents of the rights. To substantiate his claim—that the right contents are those seen in 1791—then he must rely on some external source of legitimacy for that claim—the context of the constitution does not provide that. There is a distinction between immutability and particularity. The application of a particular understanding of a right at a given time does not deny that rights immutability, nor does it mean that that understanding is the immutable right. Application of a particular understanding could merely demonstrate the best approximation of an abstract and immutable conception of a right. Scalia would likely respond that the legitimate and immutable understanding in a democracy is the one applied during the democratic process, but that argument hinges on his conception of democracy—a concept we will return to later. Thus, Scalia’s second response to Tribe and Dworkin is not as persuasive (or at least decisive) as he would like.

The third issue raised centers on the efficacy of an abstract right being defined in a democracy by the judiciary. Scalia argues that contours of the abstract principles in the Bill of Rights would be best explored in the legislature, not the judiciary: “... the argument that the repository of ultimate responsibility for determining the content of the rights (the judiciary) is a most unlikely barometer of evolving national morality but a traditional interpreter of “time-dated” laws, rests upon context as well.8” Here, though, Scalia mischaracterizes Dworkin’s argument. He is not calling for the Supreme Court to be the “barometer of evolving national morality,” but instead, for them to be the interpreter’s of the text of the constitution, a constitution which includes abstract principles—which may not be time-dated. Thus, he must explain why the principles must be time-dated, and instead of using context—as he promised to—he used tradition. Just because something has been done doesn’t make it right. To make a case for time-dated abstract principles, Scalia must look elsewhere. He has more work to do.

Thus, it seems on strict textual grounds, Scalia’s call for time-dated abstract principles is insufficient. Dworkin’s assessment of a lack of textual evidence substantiating originalism is persuasive. Nonetheless, this does not settle the issue. Dworkin could argue that the constitution itself may not require originalism, but Scalia could respond that democracy does. Moreover, Scalia insists upon the “rule of law,” and there may be a case for textualism in that concept. Nonetheless, we need a deeper story about how that law—in this case, the constitution—came to be, and then, whether that is legitimate. Moreover, if there are competing claims on the legitimizing force of originalism (or even the constitution) we will have to compare them for persuasiveness and attractiveness.

Scalia’s argument does, in fact, move past the text simply: it stands upon his conception of democracy, a proceduralist view. Dworkin needs a similar move: the constitution does not explicitly call for a “semantic intent” reading, so his analysis requires external substantiation as well. In the following section, I aim to show how both are fundamentally insufficient or, at least secondary, to competing views of democracy and democratic rights.
<h3>SCALIA’S DEMOCRACY</h3>
Scalia’s conception of democracy is fundamentally a proceduralist one. As Scalia observed in response to a question by Senator Howard Metzenbaum during his Senate confirmation hearings:
<blockquote>“[A] constitution has to have ultimately majoritarian underpinnings. To be sure a constitution is a document that protects against future democratic excesses. But when it is adopted, it is adopted by democratic process. That is what legitimates it...[I]f the majority that adopted it did not believe this unspecified right, which is not reflected clearly in the language, if their laws at the time do not reflect that that right existed, nor do the laws at the present date reflect that the society believes that right exists, I worry about my deciding that it exists.” (<em> - Hearings on the Nomination of Judge Antonin Scalia</em>)</blockquote>
This means that the legitimating force to the constitution is the effectual majoritarian ratification by the people.10 We will use a basic account of majoritarism that says when the majority passes a bill, it becomes law, and all must abide by it. Thus, along with this majoritarism comes the rule of law. Then, relying on his earlier—and well-received— arguments for textual interpretation of democratic legislative, we can see primacy placed on the text of the constitution. Still, though, we are left with the issue of semantic versus expectation intent, and in this, though, he would likely have to slide into expectation intent to substantiate his claim, though. Scalia does not fully present an argument from majoritarianism to time-dated principles, but here I will try to rehearse one. Consider rights to be immutable abstract principles—say, the right against cruel and unusual punishment— but remember that there may be disagreements over the contents or different particular applications of them.

As we are discussing changing values over time, let’s consider a mathematical illustration. Consider the abstract principle that restricts cruel and usual punishment to be the function C(t). The input in this function is time and the value is the particular understanding of that principle at that time (we’ll use an arbitrary range 1-10). So C the function doesn’t change, just the input and output. Consider these (fictitious) results: C(1600) = 2; C(1791)=5; C(1863)=2; C(1964)=8. Now at all these times, people may say they know that the principle of cruel and unusual punishment is, but, of course, the values differ. This isn’t gleaning intent, but contextualizing the notion of a right. Another important point is that we may be able to put different conceptions into perspective—and even judge what is right and wrong—but at each given time, it is likely those people thought they were right: 2 was the right answer in 1600. Now, even though the right may be immutable, for a proceduralist, it only has force once enacted by a democratic process. It was one particular democratic process that legitimated the right, and so it would have to be and understanding of that right at that time. Although eras of democrats may agree on the function, the values differ depending on the time, and only the founding values—that is, the particular conception in 1791, in this case—apply.

Furthermore, the constitution, a democratically legitimized document, itself is then a limit on the legitimate exercise of democratic principles in the future. Fixed principles would mean tighter restrictions, and from the proceduralist view of democracy, tighter restrictions—that is, concrete rights—could have instrumental value to a better realization of that conception of democracy. Essentially, the constitution sets the rules for our democratic game, and Scalia would argue, you should have some fixed rules (which, of course, can be argued over) while playing the game. Thus, time-dating is necessary and legitimate: the principles would then ensure consistency with that initial democratic procedure and have the added benefit of predictability in terms of judicial interpretation. Thus, there would be democratic and practical benefits to time dating.

Pure procedure, though, does not grasp the essence of democracy. In <em>Democratic Rights: The Substance of Self-Government</em>, Corey Brettschneider explains (indirectly) Scalia’s misunderstanding. A procedural democratic theory justifies a democratic government not by its ends, but by its means: the process of decision-making is paramount. Scalia assumes a proceduralist approach is justified, hence legitimating, but it is hard to see how this works. Although somewhat sensible, this position demands further justification: as Brettschneider puts it, “ any good procedure, like any good theory, must have reasons and principles that support it.” A simple justification for a majoritarian view holds that it maximizes the possibility for inclusion in the public decision-making process. This aim, though, could be contradicted by the result of the procedure it justifies: a democratic body—without restrictions installed—could disenfranchise a voting bloc, and thus, fail its own purpose. Although a constitution itself could limit such an anti-democratic action, using majoritarian principles to legitimate that constitution would still suffer from a similar argument. Scalia does not provide an answer to the simple question, why majoritarianism, especially to the likely minority in any case. His account is unpersuasive. A justification for the rationale behind democratic principles is necessary.
<h3>DWORKIN’S DEMOCRACY</h3>
Dworkin does—to an extent. He provides a more rich account of democracy in his <em>Justice in Robes</em>, what he calls partnership democracy. “Democracy means self-government by all of the people acting together as members of a cooperative joint venture with equal standing.”12 Incumbent on his view, then, are certain conditions that all members of a democracy must be guaranteed: equal part in political life, equal stake in government, and a private sphere. With these conditions, Dworkin escapes the minority rights problem Scalia faced, and thus, he provides a much more attractive conception of democracy. Then, majoritarian is at least justified, and ratification of the constitution via those principles as instrumental to the realization of the three principles.13 Moreover, he holds that the Bill of Rights must be morally argued by jurists, and they must constantly tend to the democratic conditions.

Dworkin’s account, though, seems to disconnect jurisprudence from the textual interpretation, altogether, which is surprising, considering his insistence on “fidelity.” If the constitution is simply instrumental to the democratic outcomes—that is, outcomes consistent with the democratic conditions—then the particular procedure is relevant and the text of the constitution is superfluous. A jurist must simply make his case during judicial review with respect to the democratic conditions—which, one should add, could provide limited liberty—not the text of the constitution. Moreover, under this partnership democracy, one could argue that a jurist has an imperative to overturn parts of the constitution itself that she considered undemocratic or, at least, prohibiting the realization of a democratic condition.

Thus, with Dworkin we see an attractive conception of democracy, but an unrestrained theory of jurisprudence. Brettschneider notes this as well, qualifying Dworkin as an outcome-oriented theorist focused on the “equal status of citizens.” That singular focus, according to Brettschneider, oversimplifies democracy, which must incorporate some notion of the process involved as well. Moreover, by selling democracy as instrumental that one good—“equal status of citizens”—Dworkin (and other epistemic theorists) loses persuasiveness. Brettschneider groups various outcome-oriented theorists—some aiming for equality, others good or truth—into a set of “epistemic theorists” and then promptly brushes them aside. It may ground the basis for democracy, but that theory must ground itself: as Brettschneider puts it, “because, the epistemic theorist has appealed to non-democratic procedure-independent standard, she must demonstrate that this standard is more fundamental than democracy.”14 This is problematic. Finding and instating a consensus on a single view of the good or source of truth would be, according to Brettschneider, unlikely and, thus, undemocratic: the imposition of a particular view on non-believers would violate their right to self-rule. Moreover, it would be nearly impossible. On other level, we can see how in terms of legitimating governance structure, an approach focused completely on the outcome lacks clarity and precision in creating an actual governing body.
<h3>BRETTSCHNEIDER’S DEMOCRACY</h3>
Brettschneider proposes an alternative definition of democracy: value theory. He provides the noncontroversial definition of democracy: “citizens authorizing legitimate law through their participation in democratic procedures.”15 Value theory is more legitimate than other procedure-independent theories as it is grounded in the ideal of democracy, not an external conception. Implicit in this definition is the idea of self-rule. It is this status, or understanding, that is more important to the particular expression of self-rule, which incorporates, to an extent, Scalia’s intrinsic valuing of majoritarianism. In appreciating citizens as self-rulers, value theory demands the proper treatment of them, which tends to Dworkin’s concerns for democratic conditions. Thus—at least to the parties to our discussion—value theory seems the most attractive.

Now we must turn the issue back around: can value theory provide a sound basis for constitutional interpretation?

Brettschneider lays out a general approach to judicial interpretation that emphasizes democracy. Value theory promises both procedural and substantive ideals, but, interestingly, it recognizes the tension between them. When procedures produce legislation that threatens rights or when legislation is overturned to protect rights, there is what Brettschneider calls a “loss to democracy.” The courts must weigh the positive value of the exercise of political autonomy in the creation of legislation against the detriment to democratic values when determining whether to overturn legislation.

Brettschneider contends that the court somewhat recognizes value theory in its acceptance of substantive due process rights, as seen in the Texas sodomy case. Moreover, value theory presents a far more attractive, coherent, and deep conception of democracy, which seems to solve Scalia’s pure proceduralism problems. At the same time, if we consider ratification of the constitution a legitimate exercise of political autonomy, then a judge upholding value theory would have to respect the text of the document as well. Value theory promises a jurisprudence more liberal than Scalia’s and more conservative than Dworkin’s: there is democratic legitimacy and judicial restraint. The Bill of Rights would be seen as listing abstract principles—just as Scalia and Dworkin admit—but they would not be time-dated. They would embody the substantive democratic rights that are, as Scalia insists, immutable, and the particular application of the understanding of the rights would be guided by the court’s understanding of the democratic values, much like Dworkin’s hope for moral interpretation. This process would overcome the arbitrary nature of time-dated principle and, at the same time, ensure set guidance for jurists in judicial review.

Of course, changes remain: uncertainty over conflicting values, limited acceptance, and loose constitutionalism. If nothing else, by examining value theory, we are able to see the shortcomings of two (alleged) textualists and recognize the role democratic theory plays into jurisprudence. Let’s examine more closely of the role, then, of the court in value theory. A proceduralist could be seen as using the judiciary as simply a check on democratic procedures: the legislature is the truly democratic institution, the courts distant cousins. Value theory, though, makes the judiciary part of the family. The courts are not simply a curb on democracy, but a dispensation of it. A strong judiciary is a member of democracy, just as much as the legislature. When the courts knock down legislation, they are not necessarily impeding democracy, but sometimes they may be protecting (or even advancing) it. Scalia is right to worry about unguided judges, free to apply their will with no popular recourse. In value theory, though, there is a guide, democratic values, and they rightly assume that there will be disagreements on the contents of our substantive rights. But those disagreements and debates are encouraged: they’re how we become <em>more perfect</em>. Once if we accept democracy as the proper reflection of our right to self-rule, then there is no reason we should not continue to explore the concept, continue to ask questions about what it means to be free, to be democratic, to be self-rulers.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[One of many amazing things my alma mater, <a href="http://cmc.edu">Claremont McKenna College</a>, does for its students is run a <a href="http://itab.cmc.edu">Silicon Valley Networking</a> trip. Short version: they take a dozen of tech-minded students on an all-expense paid tour of the valley, connecting them with alums at like of Google, Facebook, etc. Not a bad way to spend a few days of winter vacation. There are too many good things I can say about the trip -- it's what forced me to shake off my fantasy of being Alan Shore and get serious about tech, just to name one -- and based on its increasing popularity at CMC, I don't need to say much. I spoke to the crew last night, and it was clear that in just a few years the trip had already succeeded in generating more on-campus interest in technology and entrepreneurship.

Last weekend, a member of this year's trip emailed me asking how to fully take advantage of the opportunity, and since it <em>is</em> such a great opportunity, I thought I'd share my response... for whatever it's worth: 

<ul>
	<li><strong>Soak it all up</strong> -- these are all new experiences and people. Don't rush to judgement or let your mind wonder. Listen to what's being said and think about what resonates.</li>
	<li><strong>Consider fit</strong> -- More than pay, title, or location, fit matters; where you think you'll enjoy going to work every day. Pay attention to that during your tours.</li>
	<li><strong>Don't be a empty shirt</strong> -- A smart guy - really smart - just told me that every time he speaks to b-school kids, they ask for his card promising a follow-up, and he knows they never will. He hates it, as he should; it's disrespectful. Don't run to the front of the class for a handshake and card unless you actually care and will actually follow up. Take your time and theirs seriously.</li>
	<li><strong>Talk to the employees</strong> -- You're lucky to get time with bigshots in every company, but they're media trained and trained and trained. They can sell the party line. Talk to the other people in the room, the new hires, the assistants. They'll give you more insight into the actual workings of a company.</li>
	<li><strong>Think about their products</strong> -- Each company has great perks, great salaries, and great people; what separates companies at the most base level, are their products. Which one excites you? Which one do you think, "wow, that's cool"? That's who to go after.</li>
	<li><strong>CMC is a cult, a powerful one</strong> -- Make strong and meaningful connections to the people on the trip and the people you meet that you think you'll need. I recently heard a valuable lesson, "Grow your network before you need it." CMC is an admittedly small but a strong network. If you find alums on the trip you find interesting, talk to them, ask interesting questions, and then follow-up after the fact. They'll be happy, proud, and a bit self-interested in helping you out.</li>
	<li><strong>Internships are the gateway drug </strong>-- This isn't stressed enough for non-econ majors, but internships at major companies are you best way into them. When I got my Google internship, I thought it was a one-in-a-million chance getting the full-time gig. Turns out it was one-in-83; much better odds. Of course getting in the internship was like 1-in-3,000. Nonetheless, still better odds. All the major companies have internship programs, and they getting you hooked from a young age -- yes, a little like drug dealers -- so youth is actually a good thing.</li>
</ul>]]></content:encoded>

<h2><em>The Brilliance and Meaning of JFK's Inaugural Address</em></h2>
A skeptical public, a looming enemy, and a D.C. winter; On January 20, 1961, Kennedy faced a  daunting task. He had won the Presidency of the United States by a fraction—a mere 12,000 votes. He  was a Catholic, rich kid, and now he had to fill the shoes of Dwight Eisenhower, the man who won the  Second World War. The presidency itself is an unfathomable challenge, and it begins with a tremendous responsibility: the inaugural. History’s cold eye judges these speeches, and they often serve as a focal  point in an administration. Thus, Kennedy’s task was great, and so was his speech. His oratory refocused the American system on its founding principles, while expanding them to confront the current crises.  With a keen awareness of his audience and breathtaking use of prose, he crafted a concise, but effective  speech. More than anything, he set the tone for his administration, not as lofty idealism, but as  purposeful realism.

<h2>CONTEXT OF THE INAUGURAL</h2>
Aristotle defined the art of rhetoric as the ability to see what is possibly persuasive. This  demands an understanding of the context and the audience of a speech. Our rhetorical analysis will thus begin with a discussion of the circumstances, broad and immediate,  surrounding Kennedy’s inaugural  address.

In 1960, Senator John F. Kennedy declared his intentions to seek the presidency. Aside from  southern opposition from Lyndon Johnson, Kennedy enjoyed general success in the primary season,  though his Catholicism and youth forced a vigorous campaign. After the convention, he tapped Johnson  for the bottom of the ticket, adding age and southern support to his campaign. In the general election, they faced the sitting Vice-President, Republican Richard Nixon. The Democrats exploited Nixon’s  association with President Eisenhower and tagged him with negligence in curbing the U.S.S.R.’s growth economically and militarily. The U.S.S.R. had grown dramatically and was poised to eclipse the United States on the international stage, while growing increasingly hostile.

Republicans fought back with questions of Kennedy’s Catholicism. Eventually, he had to make a  public statement, distancing himself from the Church of Rome:  “I am not the Catholic candidate for  President. I am the Democratic Party's candidate for President who also happens to be a Catholic. I do  not speak for my Church on public matters  — and the Church does not speak for me.” This nonsectarian Christianity, as long as his youth, shaped his character greatly in the public eye. Political posturing helped,  but  his religious affiliation still plagued Kennedy in the election, keeping the polls close.

Inevitably, national security trumped religious discrimination. By chastising the growing “missile  gap”—the difference in numbers between the U.S.S.R. and America in ballistic missiles—Kennedy  garnered enough support to ensure a—albeit small—victory. On November 8, 1960, he won the general  election by one tenth of one percent. This victory was small; it was far short of any governable mandate. Thus, Kennedy had  considerable work to do to capture public trust and support to implement his New Frontier agenda, a  set of domestic policies emphasizing government assistance and growth. These policies had not received  tremendous approval, initially and during the campaign. In Theodore Sorensen’s analysis of the 1960  victory, he does not mention domestic policy as one of the seven top decisive factors.

Going into his  presidency and his inaugural, Kennedy would have to be careful in his handling of domestic policy. One of the top reasons for victory Sorenson does list is Kennedy’s television personality. The  1960 elections provided the first televised presidential debates. In these debates, Kennedy confounded expectations and demonstrated more poise and confidence than the sweaty Nixon. Sorenson cites this advantage as crucial to a win.  Kennedy had an acute awareness the television and media played on public opinion.

These factors all weighed in on Kennedy’s inaugural. Kennedy had to deal with questionable domestic support, a daunting international system, and new media. If the art of rhetoric if finding a way to handle the circumstances and still persuade your audience, to be effective, Kennedy’s inaugural would have to be a masterpiece.

<h2>THE CREATION AND GOALS OF THE SPEECH</h2>
To adequately understand the art of Kennedy’s inaugural, one must appreciate its origins. The staff, officially, began work on the speech in the beginning of 1961. Theodore Sorensen, Kennedy’s top aid and speechwriter, had started laying the ground work considerably earlier. As we will see later, much of the inaugural’s diction and phrasing originated from 1960 campaign. This may seen impure, but it is fairly commonsensical. The President-elect has just spent that last year  laying out his ideology and beliefs, and inevitably effective formulations would linger and even sneak into the inaugural. In his memoirs, Sorensen cites the Acceptance Speech in Los Angeles and televised campaign addresses as the source for many notable phrases.

<td style="padding: 20px;">“And so, my fellow Americans, ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country.”</td></tr></tbody></table>

Thus, the speech, itself, was a kind of amalgamation of lines from previous speeches, a near highlight reel of the top pieces of tested rhetoric. This quality made each line a possible “sound-bite” in the new age of television. The choice to have  each line very precise and self-contained demonstrates Sorensen’s and Kennedy’s keen awareness of the media and the broader audience. Though campaign rhetoric played a key role in the creation, the New Frontier and domestic policy  were slighted. In his memoirs, Sorensen recounts the difficulty crafting nonpartisan domestic policy sections of the speech. Eventually, Kennedy eased the speechwriter’s burden: He told Sorensen, “Let’s drop the domestic stuff altogether. It’s too long anyway. It’s more effective that way [without domestic policy] and I don’t want people to think I’m a windbag.”

This decision to exclude domestic policy allowed the speech to focus on foreign policy, a more uniting topic where the President-elect had already scored political points.  According to Sorensen, Kennedy “wanted it focused on foreign policy. He did not want it to sound partisan, pessimistic or critical of his predecessor. He wanted neither the customary cold war rhetoric about the Communist menace nor any weasel words that Khrushchev might misinterpret. And he wanted it to set a tone for the era about to begin.”

Thus the inaugural’s goals were harmony among friends and a novel, yet civil handling of enemies. Now let’s us begin to examine not the art of the text, but its execution of those goals.

<h2>JANUARY 20, 1960</h2>
There is no greater stage. Overshadowing the assemblage of statesman, foreign dignitaries, and Presidents, Kennedy commanded the east balcony of a newly painted Capitol with thousands of eager fans, battling the cold to see their new leader. His address, though, was to an even greater audience. Kennedy used this opportunity to speak to all members of the international community, allies, enemies
and all Americans. He had a special message, a pledge or request, for each, and he structured his speech in that manner.

<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
Kennedy began his inaugural with a traditional introduction, acknowledging the great leaders in the audience and then the great legacy before him. He grounds himself in the American tradition, reminding everyone, “I have sworn before you and Almighty God the same solemn oath our  forbearers prescribed nearly a century and three quarters ago.” Also, this attempts to counterbalance Kennedy’s youth—he was only 43 when elected. Moreover, it demonstrates the importance of the American Founding and its principles for Kennedy. This theme continues throughout the speech, while Kennedy ties America’s course in  the international situation to its guiding principles. Immediately, he makes it explicit: “…the same revolutionary beliefs for which our forebears fought are still at issue around the globe—the belief that the rights of man come not from the generosity of the state, but from the hand of God.” Thus, Kennedy set the ideological framework for his foreign policy, expanding the American view of freedom to the world. Scholar Robert Bellah takes this interpretation one step further by focusing on the reference to “Almighty God.” He argues that Kennedy’s mention of divinity while reference to his constitutional oath elevates his responsibility from just serving the American people to more universal goods.

This theme will return later in the speech.

Though Kennedy emphasizes the ideas in the Founding, he is quick to distinguish his people from past Americans: “the torch has been passed to a new generation of Americans—born in this century, tempered by war, disciplined by a hard and bitter peace.”  In this section, Kennedy is most apparently employing his character for rhetorical purposes. He turns his youth around to symbolize a new generation, contrasting the older, quieter Eisenhower. Moreover, Kennedy had served in WWII and witnessed the calcification of the Cold War. This section identifies the new President as one who has a new perspective and a basis for his views. Paragraph 4 closes with the mobilization of the Declaration of Independence, summarizing Kennedy’s general policy to “assure the survival and the success of liberty.”

<h3>FRIENDS, ALLIES, AND SISTERS</h3>
Structurally, the speech continues to address the different members of the international community. Kennedy begins with the allies.  The content of this section is largely traditional (“we pledge… loyalty”), but Kennedy’s style is still noticed. The lines, “United, there is little we cannot do in a host of cooperative ventures. Divided, there is little we can do,” begin to demonstrate the speeches technical beauty. This is an example of anastrophe—deviating from the normal order of words—a rhetorical device probably unknown to the audience, yet still powerful in delivery.

Next, Kennedy addresses new members of the free world. In his section, he tempers his idealism with a refreshing touch of realism. He does not expect the free,  skeptical world to follow America without  question. Moreover, Kennedy places responsibility for their success not in his hands, but in theirs: “we shall always hope to find them strongly supporting their own freedom.” This continues later in his address to the people still shackled by “mass misery,” when he promises to “help them help themselves.” Pragmatically, he makes it clear that America cannot be the world’s keeper, singlehandedly, nor should it be. Kennedy’s view of government (later immortalized with “ask not”) demands
joint responsibility and service to society—as seen in his creation of the Peace Corp. In his inaugural, Kennedy expanded that sense of responsibility to freedom loving people across the globe.He continues to with a call for international cooperation. First, to the “sisters” to the south, Central and South America, he pledges a “new alliance of progress” to cast off the “chains of poverty.” Pragmatism immediately follows and contrasts this idealism. “…this Hemisphere intends to remain the master of its own house.” Though lofty, this policy emphasizes national security, keeping the U.S.S.R. off our borders, again demonstrating his practical idealism. The “friends” section closes with a  vigilant promise to aid the U.N. from becoming “merely a forum for incentive.”

<h3>“TO THOSE NATIONS WHO WOULD MAKE THEMSELVES OUR ADVERSARY”</h3>
Throughout the speech, Kennedy makes somewhat vague references to the U.S.S.R. (“iron tyranny,” “back of the tiger,” “hostile powers,” etc). It should be noted that he never directly names our Cold War  adversary or any specific country for that matter. Yet the intention rings true. When he addresses “those nations who would make themselves our adversary” everyone knows who he is talking about.

In these sections, Kennedy truly demonstrates the excellence in his character. Embodying a true statesman, he unabashedly confronts the perils of the present, while striving for a better peace. Moreover, he reminds both sides the incentive to peaceful recourse, safety from “the dark powers of destruction unleashed by science.” He begins with the basis for his “request” and then continues to outlines a rough set of goals for the cold relationship.

The first goal is on based on western side of the  Atlantic: “We dare not tempt them with weakness.” This sentiment reverberates with Kennedy’s campaign, where he played the “missile gap” effectively. Some saw his next line as unnecessarily alarmist: “For only when our arms are sufficient beyond doubt can we be certain beyond doubt that they will never be employed.” Nonetheless, only
minutes earlier Kennedy had reminded the war that this generation was “tempered by war, and disciplined by a hard and bitter peace.” He had fought in a war, and he was not willing to get in another, let alone lose one. Moreover, he had intimated this sentiment before, demonstrating his honest belief that the U.S.S.R. only responded to strength.

After that note of national self-interest, he again opens the doors to more peaceful and friendly cooperation. He admits the flaws with over-militarization (“the spread of the deadly atom”) and then begins his litany of requests from both sides. They requests themselves are nothing extraordinary; they are basic calls for the use of the positive ends of human nature and science, civility and exploration (the closest reference to the New Frontier). Technically, however, these lines are breathtaking. First, each begins with the phrase “let us.” This is a classic example of anaphora, a tool Kennedy used often and even earlier in the speech. This repetition tied together the requests, while
adding structure to each individual one. The first call, “Let us never  negotiate out of  fear. But let us never fear to negotiate,” employs chiasmus, a device where phrases are reversed in order in successive sentences. This links not negotiating and desperately negotiating, emphasizing their common ineffectiveness. The other key rhetorical device in these sections and in the inaugural overall is antithesis, a
juxtaposition of contrasting words or ideas. More specifically, Kennedy often used the “not___, but___” construction, as seen in the lines, “let both sides join in creating a new endeavor, not a new balance of power, but a new world of law…” This device is throughout the speech, adding rhetorical beauty, but in this section, it serves a symbolic purpose as well. Antithesis pairs together contrasting ideas, shunning one and accepting the other. This  construction—joined, parallel phrases with a preference of one—symbolizes Kennedy’s view of the Cold War. Though he asked for peaceful cooperation, he still maintain a strong ideological preference for the American system, and this sentiment is seen and furthered throughout the inaugural.

<h3>MY FELLOW CITIZENS</h3>
Kennedy transitions from his address to the U.S.S.R. to one the American people with a note of realism: “All this will not be finished in the first 100 days. Nor will it be finished in the first 1,000 days.” Here he manages to shirk off the expectations set by FDR or any timeline. Then he finishes the repeated “let” phrases with “let us begin.” This use of the first person plural along with the mention of 100 days stages and transitions to his discussion of national issues and priorities. In these sections, Kennedy again makes the surprising transfer of responsibility. Just as he called on sovereign nations to “help themselves,” he tells the American people, “In your hands, my fellow citizens, more than in mine, will rest the final success or failure of our course.” This sentiment may seem odd coming from a man who has just sworn to “protect, serve, and defend” the Constitution. It would seem that when a President-elect places his hand on the bible and the other in the air, those hands are really picking up responsibility for success or failure. Kennedy circumvents this logic with the help of history. “Since this country was founded, each generation of Americans has been summoned to give testimony to its national loyalty. The graves of young Americans who answered the call to service surround the globe.” This responsibility has been and is the people’s duty. Thus, he places responsibility in the citizens’ hands; the hands that buried the fallen in the previous wars, the hands would carry the
weapons in the future ones.

Again Kennedy promptly follows the mention of past generations with mentions of the uniqueness  of the moment. “Now the trumpet summons us again—not as a call to bear arms, though arms we need; not as a call to battle, though embattled we are—but a call to bear the burden of a long twilight struggle… against the common enemies of man: tyranny, poverty, disease, and war itself.” The trumpet reference harkens a biblical sentiment, emphasizing the higher purpose of the current undertaking. It is this higher and broader purpose against the common enemies of man that makes it a “historic effort.” These broad and idealistic phrases and calls may seem impractical, but they serve a real purpose for the speech. They give the speech a more optimistic feel, playing to the public’s
pride: “I do not believe that any of us would exchange places with any other people or any other generation.” By making this movement unique, more would be willing to join or support it.

At this point, Kennedy has captured the immediate audience’s trust (The crowd did yell “Yes” to Kennedy’s query, “Will you join in that historic effort?”). He had devoted the speech to persuading free people—abroad and at home—to accept the responsibility of their freedom. This culminated with the immortal line, “ask not what your country can do for you—ask what you can do for your country.” If the
“success of liberty” defined Kennedy’s philosophy of government, then “ask not…” summarized his view of citizenship. The use of antithesis here is powerful, as it highlighted the drastic reversals of commonly accepted views.

Kennedy closes his inaugural address with a practical understanding that this undertaking has no tangible positives (“good conscience our only sure reward, with history the final judge of our deeds”), but he justifies its undertaking by touching on higher purposes. The last section cites many of the key motivating forces in American life, “good conscience,” patriotism (“land we love”), and the divine (“His
blessing and His help”). The successive placement of these strong drives adds energy to the closing summation, “here on earth God’s work must truly be our own.” Bellah cites that line, coupled with the other religious allusions, as the simplest formulation of Kennedy’s philosophy and—arguably—the overall American purpose.

<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
Broadly,  Kennedy’s speech served as an expansion of the American Founding. It takes the fundamental principles of our democracy and mobilizes them against tyranny abroad and apathy at home. Kennedy’s rhetoric employs classical themes (duty) and techniques (antithesis), emphasizing the seriousness of purpose. Moreover, the technical beauty and apparent thoughtfulness worked to combat the  general tendency to write off Kennedy as a naïve idealist. These techniques complemented his realist evaluation of the unstable international order. Thus, he gave his foreign policy practicality, necessity, and righteousness. Though simply put, this task would be too much for one man or one office. To ensure the success of liberty, he had to ensure all those who wanted it worked for it, from countries to people.

Overall, President Kennedy, confronted by distrust and disharmony, began his short-lived presidency by summoning the better angels of our nature, civility and responsibility.

		<title>The Forum Is No Agora: The Contradiction of a Marketplace of Ideas</title>

<blockquote>"When men have realized that time has upset many fighting faiths, they may come to believe even more than they believe the very foundations of their own conduct that the ultimate good desired is better reached by free trade in ideas -- that the best test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market, and that truth is the only ground upon which their wishes safely can be carried out. That at any rate is the theory of our Constitution.” - Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes</blockquote>
In the fall of 1919, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abrams_v._United_States">dissented</a> in <em>Abrams v United States</em> in what has now become a formative piece of legal scholarship in first amendment jurisprudence. This dissent attached a theory of freedom of expression to the language o the first amendment, relying upon the liberal conception of speech expounded by <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mill/">John Stuart Mill</a>.<a title="footnote 1" href="#1">[1]</a> Mill argued that human knowledge was fallible and needed challenge in order to grow. Since we could not know what was right, nor should we take comfort in thinking we do, we needed more opposing views to constantly check the prevailing norms. More speech and so more approximation of truth. The state was conceived as a neutral arbiter; its function was the make sure society was at liberty to go in any direction it wished to go. It was a steward of the market.<a title="footnote 2" href="#2">[2]</a>

But does speech really operate in the same kind of marketplace as commercial goods? Are campaign advertisements equatable to iPods? Tying a defense of the freedom of expression to the virtues of the free market would require and exact or close mapping of their values and functioning. Holmes and Mill merely speculated about the benefits of a marketplace of ideas, but if government regulation (or lack of regulation) is to be considered similarly, then a closer inspection is necessary. We must assess how easily the <em>Forum</em> could be called the <em>Agora</em>.
<h2>Anderson's Market Norms</h2>
In her book <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Value-Ethics-Economics-Elizabeth-Anderson/dp/0674931904">Value in Ethics and Economics</a></em>, Elizabeth Anderson takes a close look at the mechanics of the market and in what ways its values could be applied to typically non-market goods, for example prostitution and healthcare.<a title="footnote 3" href="#3">[3]</a> To do so, she works out a set of norms, which she takes to structure market relations—that is, certain characteristics of either the participants going into the market or transactional system itself. Her framework will be a useful one is determining whether speech can function in the same way as an economic good:
<blockquote>The norms structuring market relations that govern the production, circulation, and valuation of economic goods have five features that express the attitudes surrounding use and embody the economic ideal of freedom: they are impersonal, egoistic, exclusive, want-regarding, and oriented to "exit"  rather than "voice." norms with these features, thought not governing all market transactions, are characteristic of the market. They express a shared understanding of the point and meaning of market relations recognized by every experienced participant. (emphasis mine)</blockquote>
Let us consider each of these ideals in turn.
<h3>1) Impersonal</h3>
Anderson describes the impersonal aspect of market relations, "Each party to a market transaction views his relation to the other as merely a means to the satisfaction of ends defined independent of the relationship and of the other party's end." This is to say that the economic actor functions without concern for another's interest -- only her own. In fact, this impersonal nature is held to be a democratizing feature of the market, as individuals from generally opposed groups will interact for economic reasons. As Anderson puts it, "Money income, not one's social status, characteristics, or relationships, determines one's access to commodities."

Seen this way, the marketplace of ideas seems to far more personal or at least less impersonal than the standard commodities market. Access and influence are not defined singularly by one metric. Money, connections, social position, and community value substantially affect one's ability to interact with the "marketplace of ideas." Individuals and groups who would peddle their ideas to the public enjoy enormously disparate access to the channels of mass communication. Rupert Murdoch, for instance, has television networks and newspapers at his disposal. Moreover, cultural affinities and psychological predispositions distort the way ideas are bought and sold to a greater degree than is true for commodity and service markets. Whereas the market is seen as a cultural leveler, the exchange of ideas often strengthens group polarization and fracturization. Differences among humans in such capacities as articulateness and comprehension also contribute to market failure: ideas that favor intelligent, well-spoken people — the priority accorded higher education might be one example — have a distinct and unfair advantage in the marketplace. This is to say that the marketplace of ideas would not only be shaped by brute luck differences that control the distribution of wealth, but then further maligned by that very distribution.
<h3>2) Exclusive</h3>
"A good is exclusive if access to it is limited to its purchasers," Anderson explains. "If there is no means of excluding people from enjoying a good, one cannot charge a market price for it. A good is a rival in consumption if the amount that one person consumes reduces the total amount of it available to others.”[23]  Markets for goods and services generate prices and levels of output. Scarcity, both of production and consumption resources, is the phenomenon that drives markets for goods and services.

At first, if we were to treat information as a “good” rather than an “idea," the analogy for this characteristic seems applicable. A market for ideas generates a collection of individual beliefs and, in some sense, the production of observations and arguments. There is certainly a supply and a demand for information, however quantifiable. Scarcity -- in a way -- also limits what ideas can be believed and communicated: a person must choose whether to believe something or not: she must decide which few ideas from a nearly infinite pool will command her finite attention.

As Sunstein describes in <a href="http://www.littlemag.com/mar-apr01/cass.html">"The Future of Free Speech,"</a> this phenomenon is becoming increasingly apparent in light of modern technologies, where he cites MIT professor Nicholas Negroponte phrase, "enthusiasm for 'the Daily Me'.  Consumers now have seemingly complete control over the information they confronted. Whereas "general interest intermediaries" such as newspapers or nightly news programs would present an aggregation of multiple topics, points of view, and speakers, the internet allows individuals to construct their own information silo:
<blockquote>In such a system, the market for information would be perfected in the sense that consumers would be able to see exactly what they want, no more and no less. When filtering is unlimited, people can decide, in advance and with perfect accuracy, what they will and will not encounter. They can design something very much like a communications universe of their own choosing.[25]</blockquote>
Challenges still remain for the full realization of 'the Daily Me' and the free market analogy. Prices and scarcity seem to be at best roughly mapped. The production of an idea does not deplete resources available to the producer as occurs when production priorities are established regarding goods and services. In fact, more often the production of an idea creates additional intellectual resources that facilitate future production. Modern centers of innovation are living examples of this point. Mill's defense of free expression relies on this notion, since it aspires to approach truth with more and more speech. Similarly, when one consumer “buys” an idea the supply of that idea available to other consumers is not thereby diminished; in a way, it is bolstered. As Anderson explains, ideas would be a kind of "shared" not rival good: "Shared goods, by contrast, are not rival. I do not lose, but rather enhance, my pleasure in a joke by conveying it to others."[26]  In these respects, the phenomenon of scarcity does not determine how ideas are socially ordered in quite the way it determines the allocation and distribution of conventional goods and services.
<h3>3) Egoistic</h3>
One might respond that dissonance between consumer and producer power in this market merely helps it meet the necessary description of "egoistic." "Each party in a market is expected to take care of herself," Anderson writes, and so we might say that the siloed consumer made her own bed. Her choices were a reflection of her autonomy. In <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Nudge-Improving-Decisions-Health-Happiness/dp/0300122233">Nudge</a></em>, Sunstein argues that the traditional defense of free choice misses some structural threats to autonomy.[28] We must look not just at a choice but behind it, and see the impact societal norms and roles have on individual autonomy and preferences. Martha may drink a particular beverage because she was part of group and that’s just what they did – it was a societal norm. Now what if discrimination or xenophobia was a norm in her society? According to Sunstein’s definition of autonomy – an individual being able to choose reflectively and deliberately from a reasonably good set of options – the close-mindedness is intensively problematic. Martha isn’t say exposed to other cultures, and she never doubts her race is the best. Her questioning might even be ridiculed, and so she doesn’t. Considering the filtering and group polarization possible in new media, this threat seems quite real.
<h3>4) Want-regarding</h3>
Aside from the threat to autonomy, the emphasis on consumer choice in the ideas market may distort it or damage the exchange of ideas, as it would need to be a "want-regarding institution." Anderson explains this kind of institution as one that "responds to 'effective demand' -- desires backed by the ability to pay for things."[29] In the market, effective demand is often seen through substitution effects, the effect observed with the changes in relative prices of goods. Having goods of different quality and price should help a market achieve efficiency. People will compromise on their wants slightly for a lower cost. But there is no equivalent bargaining in the ideas market. The very concept of “price” is problematic when the object of consumption is ideas. What is it that a person must pay in order to “consume” an idea other than the opportunity to believe conflicting ideas? In this way, the ideas market lacks the tools to effectively measure whether individual's wants are being met.

Moreover, seen as a want-regarding institution, this market in effect seems wholly anathema to the defenses propagated by Holmes and Mill provide. "Commodities are exchanged without regard for the reasons people have for wanted them," Anderson adds, "Since it offers no means for discriminating among the reasons people have for wanting or providing things, it cannot function as a forum for the justification of the principles about the things traded on."[30]  In this regard, a commodity or service market lacks a normative dimension, and conflict and disagreement are to be avoided. Money, preference, and supply are dispositive. But, according to Mill, the marketplace of ideas should foster disagreement, with bad ideas coming up against good ones to keep us moving towards truth. We then would not want listeners and readers to be looking simply for ideas that will best serve their personal needs narrowly conceived; nor should they be complacent in their beliefs. We also expect consumers of ideas to believe some things they would not want to. For both Holmes and Mill, the social value of ideas lies to a large extent in how their production and consumption generates benefits over time for persons other than the immediate producers and consumers. But then it seems misguided to place so much faith an institute designed for immediate preference realization.
<h3>5) Oriented to Voice &amp; Exit</h3>
Finally come the concepts of "exit" and "voice" in a market. "Individuals influence the provision and exchange of commodities mainly through 'exit,' not 'voice,' Anderson argues citing Albert O. Hirschman's work, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit,_Voice,_and_Loyalty">"Exit, Voice, and Loyalty.”</a> The exit option, according to Hirschman, is when an individual simply stops buying a business's products or services or stops participating in an organization with which she is dissatisfied. Consumers in a commodities market can avail themselves of "exit." For example, if a consumer does not like the new and improved <a href="http://www.pizzaturnaround.com/">Dominos Pizza</a>, she can exercise her exit option, switch to Pizza Hut, and leave it to the former to figure out why.

"Voice" is the direct statement of an interest, preference, or dissatisfaction, while still attached or engaged to a group. If I am dissatisfied with the college I attend, I can run for student government, hold a position on the governing council, and lobby for any desired changes I'd like to see at the school. Any resulting improvements in the organization benefits me as well as my classmates. To "Exit" would be to transfer to a different college. Thus, in comparison to exit, voice is the more participatory method of providing feedback, and expressing one's preferences and values, to an organization. With exit, improvement of the exited organization comes about, if at all, courtesy of the invisible hand, and any such improvement does not redound to the benefit of the exiting consumer. Anderson describes the relationship between exit and voice in the commodities market: "The counterpart to the customer's freedom to exit a trading relationship is the owner's freedom to say 'take it or leave it.' The customer has no voice, no right to directly participate in the design of the product or to determine how it is marketed." The invisible hand of the free market acts as the feedback mechanism, as, they say, consumers vote with their wallets.

But this system of exit and voice seems altogether contradictory for a system of free expression. Considering the example of a consumer watching a media news outlet, the analogy can stand up in terms of exit: she can change the channel. Following market norms, however, this would suggest that the media outlet needs to change its coverage or content, if that taste became widespread, that it should follow the consumers who exited. Yet, both Holmes and Mill seem committed to the virtue of a diverse space for free speech, and certainly -- as we will return to -- a pluralistic democracy would benefit from the multiplicity of ideas. If the consumer is encouraged to "exit" when confronted with unwanted viewpoint, then she would merely seek to reaffirm her potentially misguided or discriminatory viewpoints. This seems to turn democracy against itself, as the majority opinions shape the public forum and slowly pervade the realm of deliberation. In effect, this model threatens to realize the French Observer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexis_de_Tocqueville">Alexis de Tocqueville's</a> fear of the media's courtier spirit and democracy's tyranny of the majority:
<blockquote>"A newspaper can survive only on the condition of publishing sentiments or principles common to a large number of men... The more equal the conditions of men become and the less strong men individually are, the more easily they give way to the current of the multitude and the more difficult it is for them to adhere by themselves to an opinion which the multitude discard.”</blockquote>
"Exit" would harmful for a democratic body, and the state might need to enact legislative to mitigate its damage. Thus, if a standard market emphasizes the "exit" mechanism, and a passive role for a consumer, it seems inapplicable for a system of free speech.

On the other hand, "voice" seems much more like the norm a free speech market should be promoting. The commitment shown by the school board member evidences a connection to the organization, a willingness to hear opposing ideas, and an interest to enhance the institution as her own standing.
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
These comparisons suggest that the standard norms in commodities market are inapplicable for a market for ideas. In every substantive way, ideas do not seem to function in a market, at all; the term "marketplace of ideas" seems contradictory. It's time we abandon the metaphor as unfit and unwise, and consider instead how we want to value, order, and protect our First Freedom.

<h3>Notes</h3>

<a name="1">[1]</a> Mill set the boundary at the point where speech or writing was an incitement to violence. He was also clear that his arguments for freedom only applied to ‘human beings in the maturity of their faculties’. Paternalism – that is, coercing someone for their own good – was in his opinion appropriate towards children, and, more controversially, towards ‘those backward states of society in which the race itself may be considered in its nonage’. But it was not appropriate towards adult members of a civilised society: they should be free to make their own minds up about how to live. They should also be free to make their own mistakes.

<a name="2">[2]</a> This very much aligns with the positive and negative view of rights propagated by Isaiah Berlin.[18] Individuals were protected within their own sphere of negative rights -- from intrusion of the state into their private affairs -- and the state had some control in positive rights, namely political participation. In terms of the first amendment, this meant that one was protected inside one's autonomous zone by libel and privacy laws, but outside it, in the combat zone, one was free to say anything one pleased.

<a name="3">[3]</a> The efficacy of market mechanisms as a comprehensive means of social ordering -- in for speech or for other goods -- run into trouble when considering market failure. As Joseph Stiglitz explains in his <em>Making Globalization Work</em>, markets are imperfect. Information asymmetry distorts markets. Collective behavior --  fractionalized interest, group polarization, etc -- can also distort markets. So too can free riders: persons who are in a position to benefit from the transactions of others without having to pay the price. In most speech settings, the audience could fairly be described as a convention of free riders. A different type of externality undermines efficiency when the full levy of social costs cannot practically be observed, measured, or assessed against those who engage in the activity. Cost and benefit do not always accurately come in to play. Careful attention to the features and characteristics of the marketplace under consideration is therefore warranted.]]></content:encoded>

<p dir="ltr">Few moments in the Nation’s history have Supreme Court decisions so aroused opposition that they were directly overruled by amendments to the Constitution. It is rare, and it obviously takes a substantial perceived shock to the governmental system before Article V’s revision machinery is called into action. The last instance resulted in the Twenty-sixth Amendment which overcame a Supreme Court decision, <em>Oregon v. Mitchell</em>, to protect eighteen-year-olds' right to vote. This is the only recollection in the last half century.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Now, there could be another. Within hours after the Court issued its ruling in <em><a href="http://www.oyez.org/cases/2000-2009/2008/2008_08_205">Citizens United v. Federal Elections Commission</a></em>, advocacy groups were called for a constitutional amendment to undo the ruling. One such group, the Campaign to Legalize Democracy, circulated an online petition to gather support for the idea; by the next morning, it claimed more than 21,000 signatures. Clearly, the Court's decision was not taken lightly.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The move to a constitutional amendment, however, is revealing. When a bill is struck down, the popular response is legislative remedy, a more specialized or less ambitious bill. The immediate jump to constitutional amendment suggests a more fundamental issue, that the Court has imposed, redefined, or stripped the meaning of a right. They had changed the rules of the game, and the people were left asking, can we change them back, please? So what riled them up? What caused the stir and sent citizens back to the latter pages of their 200 year old charter? The decision. And for good reason. <em>Citizens United</em> not only constituted a break from recent tradition that overturned multiple presents but, even more troublingly, it issued a broad re-understanding of the idea of free speech -- a corrupted and dangerous interpretation of our first freedom.</p>

<h3 dir="ltr">Background</h3>
<p dir="ltr">During the 2008 presidential primary season, Citizens United, a ideological group funded by  for-profit corporations, produced an anti-Hillary Clinton documentary to air through a cable television "video on demand" service. In exchange for a fee over a million dollars, a cable television operator consortium would have made the documentary available to cable subscribers to download free "on demand," as part of an "Election '08" series. The McCain-Feingold campaign-finance law, the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (BCRA), however, bars certain corporate-funded television broadcasts in the period before an election, and the law requires disclosure by the funders of election-related broadcast advertising.  Since Citizens United relied on corporate funding, the group feared the Federal Communications Commission would use the law to block its plans. It asked the court to forbid any such action. Citizens United never directly asked the court to overturn the campaign finance law. It only sought a declaration that the law did not apply in this case. The initial question presented was whether such a documentary distinguishes itself from the kinds of speech -- advertisements, for example -- governed by BCRA, but upon consideration, the court asked the parties to re-argue the case on whether BCRA could constitutionally ban corporate expenditures on political campaigns within the near election window.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Overruling two important precedents about the First Amendment rights of corporations, a bitterly divided Supreme Court on ruled that the government may not ban political spending by corporations in candidate elections. The 5-to-4 decision was a vindication, the majority said, of the First Amendment’s most basic free speech principle: that the government has no business regulating political speech. Through their argument, however, the majority not only undermined the findings and goals of relevant precedent, but also granted sweeping and unfounded rights to corporations, striking at the core of democratic theory.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Majority's argument seems to be two-fold: 1) corporations are effectively constitutional persons; 2) corporate independent expenditures are protected political speech.</p>

<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>The Majority’s Argument</strong></h2>
<h3 dir="ltr"><em>1) Corporations are treated as people in the law.</em></h3>
<p dir="ltr">Can a corporation be seen as just another speaker? Modern First Amendment jurisprudence is clear in its appreciation of peoples from different classes, races, and genders: the poor female Jew can speak as loudly as the rich male Muslim. Distinctions among people are non-starters for political speech restrictions. Indeed all people have the same rule on individual expenditures in a campaign. To argue that because of this corporations are treated unfairly is to argue that a corporation is for the purposes of the law effectively a person.</p>
<p dir="ltr">However odd, such claim has substantial grounding in precedent. In <em>Trustee of Darthmouth College v Woodward</em> and in many contracts cases henceforth, the Court has afforded human-like characteristics to corporations; that is to say, the Court has determined some cases and some situations when the law would look at a corporation as a human. This long-standing tradition is what allows individuals to hold corporations liable in civil court as a singular entity. It's what allows parents of a dead child to sue the manufacturers of a defective toy.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The rationale, for example, in <em>Darthmouth</em> was to enhance the corporation's ability to contract, and in others, it was to guarantee worker or consumer rights against the corporation. In both cases, however, the rationale was largely economic. The corporation would either be more efficient or more careful in its business practices thanks to its human-like attributes. There had never been purely political reasons for that extension. Corporations were never given a vote, nor was it afforded any kind of democratic respect. We did not accord them rights because we wanted to hear from them; we wanted them to make us more money. In fact, in Austin, the political-based extension was rejected plainly. The Court in Austin lambasted the entry of the corporation into the political arena, because of ”the corrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of wealth that are accumulated with the help of the corporate form and that have little or no correlation to the public’s support for the corporation’s political ideas.” Notable here is the disconnect between the corporation's function as a wealth amassing institution and the its composition of many individuals. That, the Court had said in 1990, was a compelling reason that legislators could use to single out corporations for restrictions on their political activity. This precedent thus stood as a formidable obstacle for the majority to overcome – it would have to not only reject that argument against personhood, but advance its own for it.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Kennedy takes up the task and begins by making it clear that corporations can and do speak. They can speak in many of the same ways people can: they can issue statements, purchase advertising, etc. They share the functional ability to form an opinion and broadcast with humans. And yet for the same kind of speech, the corporation can be criminally punished in the same way individuals can be punished for violations of crimes: “The law before us is an outright ban, backed by criminal sanctions... These prohibitions are classic examples of censorship.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Since corporations can speak like a person and are punished as if they a person, then they should have the same rights and restrictions on speech such as persons. But this alleged congruence, according to Stevens, seems to hollow out the meaning of human nature. Corporations have no conscience. They have no sense of justice, compassion, or empathy. Their decision-making framework overlaps with only a fraction of man's. Its interests are exclusively economic and do not include the health and welfare of society. Its acts do not reflect the will of shareholders. More importantly, it is not seeking to join and further the free flow of ideas.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This is not a point Stevens expands on too greatly, but it merits consideration. Kennedy's argument is premised upon a fear of the "chilling effect" BCRA would have on the open exchange of ideas, particularly political opinions. This is an historic conception of free speech which assumes a kind of commerce of ideas or a marketplace where more speech means more ideas and so more competition for the best one. This echos John Stuart Mill's argument for the liberal state. In this view, even bad speech is good for the market: it serves as fodder for the better ideas. This market-based conception of free speech motivates Kennedy's indifference towards both the speaker and the potential for corruption.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Notably, however, corporations in general are not seeking to join that market. They are concerned with commerce of goods, not ideas. In fact, they hope to profit off of ideas, not share them. This is easily seen when contrasting human-human political interaction with corporation-human interaction.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A misinformed voter may wrongly attempt to persuade an ignorant voter. He talks to her, reasons with her, and pleads her to change her mind for her own good. More ideas came forth, they were contested, and potentially both individuals left with better ideas to go and make their own political decisions.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Consider the case, then, of a corporation. If they were to engage in political speech, as well, it would not be as a collaborative member of the discussion but more rather a ideologue espousing only its interests. It cannot be convinced to take up ideas for non-self-interested reasons. It is an economic beast, and completely egotistical. It is a one-way participant by definition and so distinguishes itself from all others. Thus, the more likely recourse is, say, purchasing a television ad on behalf of a candidate simply for his benefit and the corporations. Again, this distinguishes this case from the other. Whereas the ignorant voter may possibly have altruistic motivations, the corporation would not. The ignorant voter watches the ad and then may or may not change her mind. Afterwards, notably, only one actor can go on to use that "interaction" for political decision-making; the corporation cannot.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This presents a <a title="The Forum Is No Agora: The Contradiction of a Marketplace of Ideas" href="http://www.abhinemani.com/2011/04/12/marketplace-of-ideas/">rather skewed vision of the open market of ideas</a>: the system is closed, the market stilted, and the ideas decidedly self-serving. More importantly, if Kennedy and others justify—at least in part—this marketplace for its direct benefits to democratic processes—a kind of consequentialist argument—then it seems there are problems for the entire enterprise. Only one party in the corporate-human political interaction can vote, the person, and that vote is potentially skewed against their more human tendencies because of the cold bias in the message. This conception of free speech threatens not only to cheapen autonomy, but also to sand it down.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Stevens flagged these very issues for democratic legitimacy and autonomy in his dissent: “Under the majority’s view, I suppose it may be a First Amendment problem that corporations are not permitted to vote, given that voting is, among other things, a form of speech.” Indeed. It is not too much to expect that lawyers for corporation may well be looking to explore the outer possibilities of their clients’ “personhood” and new-found constitutional equality.</p>

<h3 dir="ltr"><em>2) Corporate speech serves the interests of the First Amendment.</em></h3>
<p dir="ltr">The Court had to not only deal with the precedents distinguishing corporate from human speakers but also those distinguishing the value of commercial speech and that of political speech. This is not to say the Court had to argue that money and speech are equivalent; this precedent was established in <em>Buckley v. Valeo</em>: “a restriction on the amount of money a person or group can spend on political communication during a campaign necessarily reduces the quantity of expression by restricting the number of issues discussed, the depth of their exploration, and the size of the audience reached.” So that while money is not literally speech, it enables and amplifies speech when it is used to buy political advertising and therefore, according to the Court’s logic, money expended for that purpose merits First Amendment protection. Later in<em> Virginia State Board of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council</em>, Court for the first time brought commercial speech under the umbrella of constitutional protection on the reasoning that by providing information to consumers it furthers the First Amendment goal of fostering an informed citizenry. Yet a bright line remained between commercial speech and political speech, one deepened in <em>Austin</em> ("the corrosive and distorting effects...").  As Stevens argues in his dissent, the form of speech Kennedy celebrates will corrupt the free flow of information so crucial to the health of a democratic society. “[T]he distinctive potential of corporations to corrupt the electoral process [has] long been recognized.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Majority reasoned this principle should be abandoned as paternalistic: to assume corruption is to assume a gullible public. Voters are adults who must be “free to obtain information from diverse sources”; they are not to be fenced in by a government protecting them from information they allegedly could not handle. In his opinion, Kennedy argued that this kind of paternalism that seek to combat gross inequality was contrary to the political structure set up by the Constitution.  Leveling electoral opportunities means that the Congress is imposing its own judgments on what candidate capabilities should contribute to the outcome of an election. But Kennedy pointed out, "the Constitution confers on voters, not Congress, the power to choose the Members of the House of Representatives." Put another way, Congress shouldn't be able to control who you get information about Congress from—or at a minimum they should have very, very little control.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In that spirit, the Court held that corrupting potential of near election independent expenditures was not sufficiently dangerous as to justify state action. Independent corporate expenditures are not pre-arranged or coordinated with individual candidates, this "undermines the value of the expenditure to the candidate." Independent expenditures arguably do not lead to quid pro quo corruption. Without coordination, it would be difficult to have—or at least prove—causation. In fact, Kennedy goes further and argues that corporate expenditures would allow more meaningful participation for less wealthy citizens, banding together to support a cause. Their voices would be magnified, not drowned out.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Here again Kennedy follows the open marketplace approach to free speech. Fewer restrictions will create more speech, more sources of speech, and more groups speaking.  This, for the free speech accountant, is quite a good thing. However -- <a href="http://www.abhinemani.com/2011/04/12/marketplace-of-ideas/">as I've argued</a> -- substantial problems for individual rights are at issue in this dynamic.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Consider Tom, the lowly and lonely middle-aged man who works from home, freelancing. Tom has a right to free speech, but all Tom can really do is donate a few dollars to his candidate of choice or to a political action fund. There's no union he can join, no corporation, no larger for-profit group he can magnify his impact with. All he can do is donate a few dollars. In a way, one might argue that even with restrictions on independent expenditures by corporations, Tom would have little influence on the political election and a—we can say—marginal free speech usage. But, more importantly, when that restrictions his voice diminishes as more actors enter the stage and others group together and grow louder. (There in fact seems to be something deeply worrisome about a theory of free speech that seeks to encourage the loudest to further overwhelm the meek.) The community as a whole may have benefited from this effective transfer. But this would be to undermine that individual’s guarantee of that right.</p>
<p dir="ltr">To illustrate the rights violation in this effective transfer, we can turn to John Rawls theory of political equality. Justice, according to Rawls, demands fairness to persons, conceived of as free and equal. Part of the first principle in his conception of justice as fairness is a requirement of political equality, which presents the implications of this conception of justice for the organization of the political process—including voting rights, and rules for organizing elections and aggregating votes, as well as rights to freedom of political speech; the norm of equal opportunity for effective political influence — what Rawls “the fair value of political liberty”—condemns inequalities in opportunities for influencing influence political decisions. This requirement of fair value of political liberty is modeled on the idea of fair equality of opportunity. The idea is that people who are equally motivated and equally able to play the role of citizen—by exercising their capacity for a sense of justice and aiming to influence collective decisions—ought to have equal chances to exercise such influence, irrespective of economic or social position. For Tom, he would have lost his equal influence on account of both his economic and social position: he lacks the funds or connections to join a more influential group to equalize his impact. The value of his right then is diminished.</p>
<p dir="ltr">On top of this, the Majority's optimism regarding the corruption seems unrealistic. Independent expenditures ban coordination and planning before a political action by the supporting grow. In no way does this stop the candidate from seeing the advertisements or hearing about them. Nor would it stop the candidate from tracking the influence of those advertisements on her campaign. Did that ad generate a bump in the polls? Did that company end up helping or hurting? These are inevitable questions for a candidate even if the expenditures were independent. A perceptive and appreciative candidate might still be inclined to curry favor his most effective supporters, especially if the contributions were substantially higher than others who just cut him a check. A free media blitz is harder to find than a checkbook. Thus because independent corporate expenditures do in fact seem to unfairly harm individuals and lead to a real possibility of corruption, the Majority's argument seems insufficient, especially in light of centuries of precedent against them.</p>

<h2 dir="ltr">Conclusion</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Most broadly, however, Citizens United should unsettle democratic citizens not because of its break from precedent or unsound argumentation, but because of its implication. It positions citizens and corporations on the same level, effectively saying that you and me are no different than Comcast or Sears. It considers a corporation's messaging and marketing as important as your voice and speech, giving Starbucks the same (if not more) influence on a campaign as you.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It is wrong.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It's time we remember that, "<a href="http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution.html">We the People</a>," still means something.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[“Let us endeavor to make the best of that which is allotted to us and, by finding out both its good and its evil tendencies, be able to foster the former and repress the latter to the utmost.”<a title="" href="#_ftn1">[1]</a> This was Alexis de Tocqueville’s endeavor in his famed, <em>Democracy in America</em>. He had surmised a providential fact, the movement of mankind towards equality of conditions—and so democracy—and it was this “allotment” that he sought to measure and examine. And measure it he did, in line with the judgment, “a sip of democracy is a dangerous thing, but a deeper drink sobers rather than intoxicates.”<a title="" href="#_ftn2">[2]</a> Although—like his contemporaries—he saw much to fear in democracy, he also saw—unlike most of them—American democracy maintain itself. Grounding in his observations, his analysis recasts conventional definitions democracy and associations and uses them to demonstrate how liberty can be sustained, and despotism avoided. Democracies’ better angels would shout down its demons.

As its cures sprung from itself, Tocqueville’s democracy, first, requires examination. His vocabulary in this area has been criticized. As Jack Lively concluded, “It has been pointed out many times how confused he was in the use of his basic concepts, democracy and equality.”<a title="" href="#_ftn3">[3]</a> This confusion, though, can be both rationalized in a historical context and reconciled within the text itself. In Tocqueville’s time, according to Welch, democracy was seen primarily in the political sense—a form of government, a location of sovereignty, or the prioritization of the middle class. Tocqueville’s immediate forbearers—namely Guizot—saw democracy along this vein, but in a negative sense: as a corrupting and chaotic political system. Thus, Tocqueville’s intellectual background would have bent accordingly, but his prose refute this interpretation: “The more I advanced the study of American society, the more I perceived that this equality of condition is the fundamental fact from which all others seem to be derived, and the central point at which all my observations constantly terminated.” As such, we cannot exorcise democracy from its social or civil implications—or even equality at all—as Tocqueville perceived them as fundamentally linked. This corresponds with Tocqueville’s own historical views of the drive towards equality, which has birthed a new form of democracy.<a title="" href="#_ftn4">[4]</a> Thus, we can accept Welch’s reconciliation of the term confusion:
<blockquote>“…he often uses equality of condition as a virtual synonym for democracy. More typically, however, his usage is a slightly broader one that includes in the term ‘democracy’ both equality of social condition… and the psychological tendencies that such equality naturally encourages… This broadened use—equality of condition plus the egalitarian passions and tastes for freedom to which it gives rise—is perhaps Tocqueville’s most characteristic meaning for the term ‘democracy.’”<a title="" href="#_ftn5">[5]</a></blockquote>
Welch’s juxtaposition of the “egalitarian passions” and the “tastes for freedom” frames the next relevant issue—that is, contrast between the drive toward equality and the appetite for liberty. The affection of equality is greater in democratic limes, as Tocqueville laments:
<blockquote>“I think that democratic communities have a natural taste for freedom; left to themselves, they will seek it, cherish it, and view and privation of it with regret. But for equality their passion is ardent, insatiable, incessant, invincible; they call for equality in freedom; and if they cannot obtain that, they still call for equality in slavery. They will endure poverty, servitude, barbarism, but they will not endure aristocracy.”<a title="" href="#_ftn6">[6]</a></blockquote>
His lamentation, coupled with his frequent concerns of despotism, solidifies his intellectual identity: he is a liberal. His particular conception of liberty is crucial to understanding his belief in the corrective affects of associations, as we will see.

“Freedom is, in truth, a sacred thing,” affirmed Tocqueville. This seems to contradict his seemingly deterministic view of view—the inevitable drive towards equality. Yet, he vigorously defended the role of human choice in shaping that march. To keep men from the captivity of despotism, he would argue, a choice was necessary, the choice between educating democracy and succumbing to it. He concludes, “…it depends on [the nation’s of our time] whether the principle of equality is to lead them to servitude or freedom, to knowledge of barbarism, to prosperity or wretchedness.”<a title="" href="#_ftn7">[7]</a> In that, we see the crux of Tocqueville’s view of the relationship between history and liberty. If equality was the engine of history, then man would still meet juncture, demanding choices, and these choices would lead to either more liberty or less. In that, we can see the duality of his views of liberty: it is not simply about having a choice, but also choosing to have more choices. As a liberal, then, Tocqueville would seek to guard not only against the encroachment on liberty, but also the abdication of it.

Still, though, the foundations of Tocqueville’s liberalism require contextualization: why advocate freedom of choice altogether? He offers one explanation in a letter to Beaumont, “I have never been more profoundly convinced that [liberty] alone can give to human societies in general, and to the individuals who compose them in particular, all the prosperity and greatness which our species is capable.”<a title="" href="#_ftn8">[8]</a> These observations match—or may even reflect—John Stuart Mill’s defense of liberty as a catalyst for human progress: as Lively explains, without freedom of thought and expression, without a wide area of free actions, there could be neither the development of individuality, the flowering of each individual’s unique personality, nor the intellectual progress that sprang from a diversity of values and class of opinions within a community.”<a title="" href="#_ftn9">[9]</a> These arguments, though, fail to fully capture Tocqueville’s views. Furthermore, in Volume II, Tocqueville rails against unchecked individuality, as an atomizing and corrosive symptom of democracy, and this worry betrays his broader conception of liberty (and even his debt to Guizot). Consider again, the statement quoted in part earlier, “Freedom is a <em>sacred</em> thing. There is one thing else that better deserves the name: that is virtue. But then what is virtue if not the free choice of what is good.”<a title="" href="#_ftn10">[10]</a> Liberty, thus, allows for individual virtue; it is not simply beneficial to society or civilization, but also to man—it constitutes moral terrain. When government forces action, even if moral, it appropriates that ground, dissolving virtue and, in effect, upending man’s morality. The same happen when man relinquishes his liberty; he has no footing to grasp virtue.

Tocqueville’s conception can then be seen as a virtuous liberty, and as either the ability or the desire to take moral actions waned, so did virtue. Thus, man must both will and have freedom; only then would he escape the slide toward despotism.

This tendency towards despotism thus constitutes the paramount evil of democracy—in both the social and political forms.

With equality of conditions, each man is free and able to get and do what he would like, free of classist restrictions. In that, Tocqueville argues, equality unleashes a dangerous passion: a passion for well-being, aroused to a more animated and acceptable position. Now that men <em>can</em> have anything, they become equal not only in their status but their desires: men <em>do</em> want everything. Complete satisfaction is unrealistic; thus a constant restlessness afflicts democratic society. This thirst for material prosperity turns man towards commerce and industry and, more importantly, onto his own affairs, his own interests, himself. Economic concerns, according to Tocqueville, then drown out political ones. Simply put, the opportunity cost of political participation would be too high.<a title="" href="#_ftn11">[11]</a> The more subtle and more worrisome effect of materialism is the considered retreat from the political activity altogether—more worrisome as it not only rationalization political inaction but also political apathy. This is Tocqueville’s individualism, the slower but similarly corrosive cousin of egoism:
<blockquote>“Individualism is a novel expressions, to which a novel idea has given birth… Individualism is a mature and calm feeling, which disposes each member of the community to sever himself from the mass of his fellows and to draw apart with his family and friends, so that after he has thus formed a little circle of his own, he willingly a leaves society at large to itself.”</blockquote>
Individuals equally form society, so as they withdraw into isolation, not only is society torn asunder, but also a vacuum emerges. This precipitates further alienation and atomization, and the latter invites government to fill the void, which—as we’ll see—it is happy to.

The political nature of democracy play into this story as well, further sapping man of his capacity for independent action. The American system enshrined the majority as the source of legitimate governmental action. This preference, though, seeps throughout society, encouraged by equality of conditions. Whereas a few had power in an aristocracy, all do in a democracy. Each man then has power, but as such, none does. The independence of democratic men leaves them thinking they must know what’s best, but in the law, only the majority does. Thus, vocalizing dissent demonstrates a failure to appreciate or respect the majority’s authority, legal and moral. Thus, men succumb to conformity: if the majority is always rights, then I am always with the majority. They see now need to add their opinion; they merely follow the currents of the many. Thus a “courtier spirit”<a title="" href="#_ftn12">[12]</a> inhabits the democracy, and in turn, the majority plays the part of the despot. Here again, the individual willingly gives up his ability to make one’s own choices, costing him the opportunity for moral action and meaningful freedom.

Materialism, individualism, and the majoritarian impulse leave democracies atomized and rife for despotism. The majority is eager to play the role of tyrant, but there remains one other force willing and able to ease man of his capacity for independent action: a centralizing government administration—that is, according to Welch, “the unnecessary expansion of political power into the regulation of ordinary affairs and the details of daily life.”<a title="" href="#_ftn13">[13]</a> Tocqueville contends that there is a natural disposition in democracy towards strong central power, as the economic man wants stability and the independent man feels powerless.  The abdication to central administrative power seems like a good bargain: trade an increasingly burdensome liberty for peace of mind at no loss to equality.  Thus, the government, erected for he general welfare, effectually undermines the people’s ability to provide their own welfare, thus, as above, cutting in their capacity to take moral actions, to govern themselves.

Thus the arc from liberty to the complete loss of it comes complete: Equality of conditions bring men onto the same plane; materialism turns them into their own homes; individualism erects fences; the majority keeps each inside; and the state keeps them all comfortable. Men, no longer <em>bothered</em> by liberty, become equal slaves.

This nightmare is avoidable, argued Tocqueville. The engine of equality could run towards despotism, but it could also turn away. Democracy <em>could</em> maintain itself. His claims here was primarily built on observation—he saw it work—but also on analysis. In fact, the very same forces that led to an atomized, tyrannized society could lead to an interdependent, self-regulating one. The “taste for freedom” and the “egalitarian” passions encourage associational life, and through associations, citizens both use and defend their liberty.

This process, too, was the product of democracy itself, and Tocqueville’s logic is discernable. Equality of conditions leaves all men equal in their capacity, but in a sense completely powerless. This offends their somewhat independent spirit also precipitated by equality of conditions. Man, then, must find a mechanism to have power, to make influence—really, to indulge in his constructive liberty—or else he will recoil into this private life. Enter democratic associations. Ranging from small interest groups, to political parties, and even townships, associations carry the democratic concept to the grassroots.

Each type of association, though, has a particular way to neutralize the evils of democracy in different ways.

Free provincial institutions come first, accordingly, as they are, according to Tocqueville the natural product of equality—an immediate result of their perceived independence. He conjectures that with equality of conditions, there is a “natural bias towards free institutions.”<a title="" href="#_ftn14">[14]</a> His reasons are fairly intuitive and two-fold: first, arrogantly, man, Tocqueville explains, “will contest conceive and most highly value that government whose head he has himself elected and whose administration he may control;”<a title="" href="#_ftn15">[15]</a> second, self-interested, men’s’ “…chief business is to secure for themselves a government which will allow them to acquire the things they covet and which will not debar them from the peaceful enjoyment of those possessions which they have already acquired.”<a title="" href="#_ftn16">[16]</a> In addition, necessity of collective action—say to build a road—would require entry into public affairs. Thus, man will attend to the free institutions, as they are now his and his interests are at stake.

These forces might seem to merely enhance individualism and materialism, but the nature of American free institutions serves to combat not only those vices, but also administrative centralization.

These institutions were numerous and local, so in attending to them, men had to come together. In this way, Dana Villa rightly argues that they are a kind of association in Tocqueville’s work, and their nature as fixed and standing earns them the title: permanent associations.<a title="" href="#_ftn17">[17]</a> The same powerless of the individual is felt but then reconciles once he discovers that “he is not so independent of his fellow men as he had at first imagined, and that in order to obtain their support he must often lend them his co-operation.”<a title="" href="#_ftn18">[18]</a> Pretty pride disintegrates, arrogance recedes, and intrapersonal connections emerge. Self-interest even spurs compromise and compassions, as a resourceful democrat will aim to win favor. Tocqueville adds to these somewhat intuitive claims, that public affairs are to an extent contagious, that in time man will attend to them not by necessity but by choice, and that the self-interested compromise will become habitual altruism and service.

On one hand, then, permanent associations combat the atomization and individualism. As a nexus of liberty—where people have choice they want to make—these associations safeguard against the ills of social democracy. They also are a more immediate front against despotism, as decentralizing forces.

The rationale here is largely obvious: provincial administrations assumed the duties commonly assigned to centralized national administrations. In that, there is simply less need for centralization, and an eager central administration would have to confront the collective pride of towns accustomed to and energized by self-rule. Just as importantly, the decentralization create natural barriers to the tyranny of the majority as it’s faced with numerous, disparate groups to infiltrate, win, and effectively lull.<a title="" href="#_ftn19">[19]</a> As such, Tocqueville holds them in high esteem, considering them the second greatest legal cause for the maintenance of the American democratic republic, “which limit the despotism of the majority and at the same time impart to the people a taste for freedom and the art of being free.”<a title="" href="#_ftn20">[20]</a>

Permanent institutions, as they were, constituted politically democratic institutions, where the individuals could exert their independence and develop a sense of interdependence safe from the perils of anarchy thanks to limited power. Thus, they were hotbed of the beneficial democratic mores, by providing a taste of freedom and introducing men to the art of associations.

Advanced training came from political and civil associations.

As Tocqueville explains, political associations—political parties, for example—are “large free schools where all members of the community go to learn the general theory of association.”<a title="" href="#_ftn21">[21]</a> Civil associations—for example, professional associations—are similarly instructive, but often require risks and thus are not “free.”

Civil and Political associations, though, are closely related, as Tocqueville explains. They are similar in that men come together to achieve a goal, both tethering the individual to the collective. The phenomenon, much like the initial attendance to public affairs, was an outgrowth of self-interest. As men were individually powerless, they came together by necessity—as a form of even shallow self-interest—and soon, he wrote, it became instinct: “As soon as several of the inhabitants of the United States has taken up a opinion or a feeling which they wish to promote in the world, they look out for mutual assistance, and as soon as they have found one another out, they combine.”<a title="" href="#_ftn22">[22]</a> Thus, the independence of equality of conditions also fosters interdependence: “From that moment, they are no longer isolated men, but a power seen from afar, whose actions serve for an example and whose language is listened to.”<a title="" href="#_ftn23">[23]</a> In this, they overcome their individual enfeeblement and gain a sense of associational power.

Civil associations, in addition, constituted the antithesis of administrative centralization. Not only were they loci of liberty, but they were decentralized administrations as well. Tocqueville ironically remarked that what was commonly performed by an aristocracy’s central administration was attended to by an American association. They were, in a sense, democratic foot soldiers—with newspapers as air support.  Newspapers give civil—and even political—associations greater reach, unifying disparate groups and, if necessary, raising them against an oppressive force—be it the tyrannical majority or an imposing bureaucracy.

The forms of associations—permanent, political, and civil—have different corrective effects but share a corrective mechanism. For Tocqueville, democracy—broadly understood—gave rise to both egalitarian passions and “tastes of freedom.” Together, they instilled both restlessness and independence, but only the art of association would seem to satisfy those passions—which, though, it couldn’t. Instead it tempered them and combined them into self-interest rightly understood—that is, self-interest that is aligned with the communities interest. It is the habit generated by associational life that forces man both above himself and into public affairs.

Self-interest right understood can be seen as a kind of <em>civic virtue, </em>but in this context, it’s more appropriately seen as a <em>democratic</em> virtue, as it would pervade a healthy democracy. This seems to explain Tocqueville’s bold assertion that, “the principle of self-interest rightly understood appears to me the best suited of all philosophical theories to the wants of the men of our time…[and] their chief remaining security against themselves.”<a title="" href="#_ftn24">[24]</a>

This boldness hints at a more axiomatic reason underpinning Tocqueville’s belief in the corrective power of associations. The greatest evil of democracy was tyranny, in which there would be no liberty, no free choice of moral action, and no chance of virtue—a bleak but probable outcome considering the “insatiable” passion for equality and the subtle abdication of liberty to it. Thus, political liberty must be made more attractive and its exercise more common. Associations multiply the loci of liberty throughout society, and, by injecting enlightened self-interest into democracy, they redirect the very forces once opposing liberty to motivate its expression. Associational life thus sustains liberty and even instill a kind of virtue that, however lowly, still triumphs above the “barbarism” and “wretchedness” of despotism. <a title="" href="#_ftn25">[25]</a>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I woke up this morning thinking about politics. It’s not something I normally do, but I couldn’t shake it. Why? I was realizing that while my job isn’t about politics — it’s about the day-to-day of governance and how the internet can help — it turns out that recent politics might make that a little harder. It has been said that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_Online_Piracy_Act" target="_blank">Stop Online Piracy Act</a> (or SOPA) may “<a href="http://www.stanfordlawreview.org/online/dont-break-internet" target="_blank">break the internet</a>,” undermining the creativity and free expression that has made it not only unbelievably popular, but also remarkably powerful. Now, thanks to a growing movement called <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2011/12/gov-2-open-data-civic-apps-npr-ap.html" target="_blank">Gov 2.0</a>, thousands of people go to work everyday believing the power of the internet to help government, but it turns out the government might just kill the internet. Some appreciation that is.

So I think it’s time we raised the stakes. If the politicians want to get in on this game, they should to be held accountable, and we need an honest debate around the issues. And SOPA is just one of many. The internet is everywhere. Nearly every function of government — ranging from supporting the economy and education, to offering social services and fighting wars — either does already or will soon rely on the internet. So let’s talk about that. Clearly, honestly, and publicly.

So here’s my pitch: a <strong>#Gov20 Presidential Debate</strong>. Bring the Republican and Democrat candidates together to discuss what the internet means to government and society, and how their administration would leverage it. What makes this interesting to me is that the pressing questions aren’t strictly partisan; transparency is probably a bipartisan issue, and I’d imagine the Republicans might split on immigration &amp; innovation, and the Democrats on, say, downsizing government through tech. Should be fun.

Realizing, as a <em>somewhat</em> reasonable person, that such a thing is unlikely (ok, <strong>very unlikely</strong>) to happen, I still figured that as an exercise it’d be fun to think of some questions. Here are a handful or so I thought of; share your ideas on the debate and for questions in the comments.
<ul>
	<li>Do you think the “Stop Online Piracy Act” will hinder innovation and creativity on the internet?</li>
	<li>The Obama Administration created two C-Level tech-focused position: CIO and CTO. Do you think those roles are necessary and would you keep them in your administration?</li>
	<li>We’ve seen that advances in modern technology have enabled companies in the private sector to grow and cut costs. How would you use technology to bring down the deficit?</li>
	<li>Why shouldn’t every document or record created by the government be immediately accessible online?</li>
	<li>In cities, throughout the country, <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=the-social-nexus&amp;page=4" target="_blank">local governments are turning the government as a service provider model on its head</a>, and asking citizens to solve the local problems themselves. How would you apply this thinking to the federal government?</li>
	<li>What would you do to boost entreprenuership in this country? Would you change immigration laws? Provide government seed funding?</li>
	<li>Over 50 countries have joined the <a href="http://www.opengovpartnership.org/about" target="_blank">Open Government Partnership</a>. Has it produced any real results and can/will it affect foreign policy?</li>
</ul>
I’ll add that there would be a real expressive value to a debate like this — probably more valuable than the discussion itself. This could serve as validation for the fundamental importance of the web and the role it’ll play in our society. These are exciting time we live in, where there’s tremendous innovation constantly in our lives, and there’s a real opportunity to leverage that in our governments — the institutions designed to serve us all. And strong support from our political leaders would hopefully push forward that process, raise public awareness, and validate the efforts by change-makers both inside government and out.

Ding-dong, the witch is dead; three clicks and Dorothy is back in Kansas.  The Wizard of Oz seems oddly like Angels in America.  Similarly, the evil Roy Cohn dies, and innocent Prior renews his lease on life.  There's no place like home… or America.  Yet, the play's hallmark end merely masks the deeper, tragic allegory.   Prior chooses to live, a choice that damns him to a life riddled with a degenerate disease:  It is life, but at a terrible cost.  This folly, however, was the human choice, the American choice even.  Progress defines America, no matter the heinous consequences.  Thus, he becomes the American tragic hero, and just as he—and we all—must live, America must progress, however painfully.  Kushner laces the seemingly optimistic plot with the darker reality, providing a bearable existence.  The American tragedy is inevitable yet entertaining, depressing yet funny.

If happiness is the most positive human emotion, then schadenfreude must run a close second.  Schadenfreude is the psychological phenomenon, emotional response, triggered by witnessing another's downfall—specifically the plight of an evil, terrible figure.  Scholar John Portmann defines the concept as "a rational emotional affirmation of a justly constituted world where certain modes of suffering elicit appropriate responses." [1]  Basically, we enjoy watching bad man pay.

Enter Kushner's Roy Cohn.

Roy Cohn, no matter his power or clout, cannot escape his fate.  His tale has a subtle sense of irony.  Roy tries to confound every stereotype associated with his existence.  He is a Jew-bashing, homophobic, gay Jew.  John Quinn aptly describes the sleazy lawyer, "In short, Cohn is a diseased version of the norm." [2]  Slowly, his life unravels.  The Bar Association comes after his license for accepting a loan from a client.  His prodigy, Joe Pitt, turns down his D.C. job offer, which would actually save him from the Bar's wolves.  And his secret homosexuality catches up with him, when he diagnosed with AIDS.  Kushner candidly expounds every bitter degradation of the character.  The disease slowly eats away his body and mind, while the Bar takes away his only real self-identifier, his law license.  On the deathbed, he scoffs at the chance of pity.  Ethel Rosenberg compassionately responds to his painful plea for a song.  After it seems he has redeemed himself slightly in Ethel's and the audience's eyes, he snaps back into life with his cynicism: "I fooled you Ethel…  I could finally, finally make Ethel Rosenberg sing!  I win!"  It was all a game for Roy.  Yet, he lost the larger one, and shortly after, he dies.  Just bliss.

With the audience's need for schadenfreude sufficiently placated, Kushner turns to their hearts.  His epic tale of life, death, and homosexuality closes with joy and happiness all around.  "The Berlin Wall has fallen.  The Ceaucescus are out.  He's building democratic socialism.   The New Internationalism.  Gorbachev is the greatest political thinker since Lenin."  After two books full of anguish, disease, and sadness, Louis begins the epilogue with a proclamation of good will.  The international chaos of past has resolved, and the Cold War is over.  Moreover, the miracle AZT has pumped life into the disease-riddled Prior.  Five years ago, he was in the hospital, near death, and alone.  Now, his life is full and full of hope.  Louis, Belize, and Hannah stand beside him, visiting the Bethesda Fountain in Central Park: "When the millennium comes…  [t]he fountain of Bethesda will flow again.  And I told [Prior] I would personally take him there to bathe.  We will all bathe ourselves clean," says Hannah.  She promises him purification on the day of redemption, whenever that may be. That sentiment—along with the pleasing scenery—makes Bethesda Prior's "favorite place in the…whole universe." He loves the hope.

Scholar Peter Cohen summarizes the emotion, commenting, "a symbol of the healing and reconciliation that becomes central to the play's final vision." [3]  Kushner himself described Perestroika as a comedy, citing its optimistic sentiment.  It ends with the wrecking of the fourth wall and Prior's stirring call to arms against the AIDS epidemic.  The audience, assuredly, leaves the theater feeling positive and—dare I say—hopeful.

Some criticize the playwright for this ending: "Angels in America's epilogue has come under attack from a number of critics who have viewed the play's feel-good ending and Prior's blessing of the audience as a sop intended to placate a mainstream Broadway audience." [4]  Cohen rebuffs this contention, reconciling the clichéd finale with the overall theme of activism: "Having offered audiences both a denunciation of Reaganism and a vision of community and collective action, Kushner instructs them that the process of social change he envisions is not an imaginative process, but rather one that can only "begin" once the play itself has ended." [5]  Both of these stands, however, fail to properly examine the context and reality of the feel-good ending.

<h3>What's Really Good</h3>

Let's begin by reevaluating the setting.  Prior's favorite place is actually a cold, barren park.  He describes its beauty in yesteryear, but only in contrast to its current shortcomings.  "In autumn, those trees across the lake are yellow, and the sun strikes those most brilliantly. Against the blue of the sky, that sad fall blue, those trees are more light than vegetation.  They are Yankee trees, New England transplants.  They're barren now." Thus, the present pales in consideration to the past.  Quite literary, the present is empty, frozen.  "The fountain's not flowing now, they turn it off in the winter, ice in the pipes."  The hope that he searches for, yearns for, is based off the past or the future.  Yet, even that is misplaced.  Louis cited Gorbachev's brilliance and the promise of the new Russia, but that idea failed. When Kushner was writing Angels in America, Gorbachev was selling pizzas in Pizza Hut advertisements.

Moreover, Kushner's stage notes sap from the optimistic sentiment.  "It's a bright day, but cold…  Prior is heavily bundled, and he had think glasses on, and he supports himself with a cane."  This calls into question how well Prior has been living with his AIDS.  Even with the Angel's blessing, the miracle ATZ pills, and his friends' care, his state has degenerated, and he needs the cane to "support himself."  Clearly, things are not as good as they seem, and the critics' chastisement of the "sop" lacks complete justification.

Cohen's reconciliation draws on more than pure sentiment for evidence.  "Angels in America would have been a tragedy of sorts if it had ended with Prior's refusal to allow Louis to return, drama's ability to represent the group allows Kushner to transform his play into a comedy that is grounded in a vision of communal purpose and action." [6]  His analysis points to the neo-family structure in the Epilogue for some optimistic solace. Even though the classical relationships of man-woman or even man-man fail, he argues, societal unity prevails in the ends, reinforcing the belief in the community and collectivism. Yet, one must ask, how real is this family?

<h3>A Family is Appearance Only</h3>

A WASP, a black man, and a Jew—all gay and single—paired with a single, Mormon mother figure: What kind of family is that?  True, these individuals have come together and co-exist, but are these associations forced or welcomed?

Louis arguably commits the worst kind of sin.  His friend, roommate, and lover battles AIDS, and instead of providing comfort and solace, he leaves… and sleeps with a Mormon.  Yet, he eventually comes back to Prior, and when he does, he is not reaccepted.  Prior says, "I love you…  But you can't come back.  Not ever.  I'm sorry.  But you can't."  That said, the epilogue shows them together.  Their demeanor hints at subtle annoyance, with Prior's quip, "I've been living with AIDS for five years now.  That's six whole months longer than I lived with Louis."  Furthermore, Louis's relationship with Belize maintains the habitual animosity.  Kushner tells us in the stage notes, "Louis and Belize are arguing."  Their discussion of the Middle East provides an adequate metaphor for the relationship.  Just as Israel and Palestine fruitlessly strive for some kind of coexistence, these brothers bitterly push on, existing simultaneously but not truly together.

The most obvious idiosyncrasy must be Hannah.  This Mormon, spouseless woman seemingly leaves her own son to "adopt" three gay kids.  Her religion despises and rejects homosexuality, yet she stomachs the ideological issues these orphaned men.  Compassionate yes, but was her decision truly deliberate or merely immediate?  Her character seems slightly irrational.  Upon a quirky phone call from Joe, she sells her house and comes to New York from Salt Lake.  When asked, she says, "I don't know why I came here."  She is uncomfortably decisive, and she falls into unnatural situations.  Similarly, after a few moments of conversation with Prior, she helps him to the hospital, cares for him, and eventually becomes a central figure in his life.  Catherine Stevenson describes her as a "surrogate mother," [7] to Prior and Harper.  Nonetheless, her transition from Salt Lake Mormon to New York neo-mother seems forced.  In the Epilogue stage notes, Hannah is "noticeably different—she looks like a New Yorker, and she is reading the New York Times."  She is playing the character of the New Yorker—much like the New England transplant trees—too well.  Stevenson summarizes this staged metamorphosis as "a journey that is the antithesis of the Mormon pilgrimage in a number of ways." [8]  She rejects her earlier lifestyle and accepts this one; her only justification comes when she responds to Prior's plea for company in the hospital: "I'm not needed elsewhere."

This family, Prior, Belize, Louis, and Hannah, seems collectively bound and oddly natural.  Nonetheless, pain, bitterness, and idiosyncrasies riddle that group.  They have little in common, constantly bicker, and lack love in any conventional sense. Then what overcomes the obvious tension?  Cohen's answer is that the "characters are shown to have found sustenance not through the isolative institutions of conjugal marriage or the bourgeois family, but through the benefits of group friendship (emphasis added)." [9]  This collective bands together for "sustenance" to survive.  While Cohen maintains that this phenomenon demonstrates Kushner's beliefs in collective action, they are not making action—they are surviving.  They need each other to cope with the knowledge the past events has burdened them with.  Prior stomachs Louis's treachery, Belize placates Louis, and Hannah finds somewhere that she is "needed."  This story is not one of optimism or progress, but one of tragedy.  The sheer depth and horror of that tragedy forces these characters to come together, just to live with it.

<h3>The Tragedy</h3>

Kushner himself rebuffed the notion of Perestroika's tragedy, but Aristotle would beg to differ.  In his Poetics, Aristotle laid out the classical definition of tragedy, as seen in great works such as Oedipus Rex. The crux of Aristotelian tragedy lies within the main character himself.  The basic motion of a tragedy is downhill with one lifeboat at the end of the cliff.  To jump on, the character must make the right decision, not right based on morals or ethics, but on intellect.  The "victim" has a final chance of salvation, which is quickly taken away.  Aristotle puts it as, "misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error or frailty." [10]  From that point onward, his fate is sealed, and his pain and downfall staged.  What is worse, these heroes tend to pursue their decision, fervently, to a bitter end.  Thus, inherent frailty dictates his demise.  That is the tragedy.

The "tragic flaw" in Angels in America is hard to find for two reasons. First, the ending seems happy and positive—much unlike Greek tragedies such as Oedipus. Second and more cumbersome, we do not want to find the tragedy in the play. The work seems to convey a tremendous amount of hope and strength in the human character, and sapping from that is hard.  Regrettably, Kushner's work demonstrates the greatest of tragic flaws, the human flaw.

Prior, the prophet of stasis, rejects his prescribed destiny.  From the outset, he rejects the "Great Work."  Yet over time, he deliberates the issue, pontificating and reiterating the story to others.  When describing the angel's visit to Belize, his language and tone almost convey acceptance of the prophesy.  "It's all gone too far, too much loss is what they think, we should stop somehow, go back."  Belize responds, "But that's not how the world works, Prior.  It only spins forward."  Prior's telling quip is "Yeah, but forward into what?"  The inflection on that question reminds the audience that he has seen the end of progress. When he picks up the spectacles, the peep-stones, he sees a terrible image—undoubtedly, the image of chaos destined for humanity.  The angel herself expands on the bitter end: "Surely you see towards what we are Progressing, the fabric of the sky unravels…  Before the boiling of blood and the searing of the skin comes the Secret catastrophe: Before Life on Earth becomes finally merely impossible, it will for a long time before have become completely unbearable."  Initially overwhelmed, Prior eventually sees the harshness of progress in his own life: "It's 1986 and there's a plague, half my friends are dead and I'm only thirty-one."  Then comes the realization.  "Maybe I am a prophet.  Not just me, all of us who are dying now.  Maybe we've caught the virus of prophecy.  Be still.  Toil no more."  AIDS is the disease of progress, and the world is infected.

That tragedy is sad, but too real; Aristotelian tragedy demands a character's imprudence and downfall.  Later, Prior plays this role as well.

<h3>The Tragic Flaw</h3>

Prior bounces back and forth between rationalizations: He is insane, and the angel was just a hallucination; or, he is sane, and all he can do is run away from the prophesy.  Neither is sufficient, yet he continually characterizes the angel's visit as insane.  Understandable, this makes its rejection rational.  If he accepts the "Great Work" as real, then he must—rationally—pursue it.  In his debate with Belize, he comes to that conclusion.  "Maybe the world has driven God from heaven, incurred the angels' wrath.  I believe I've seen the end of things."  Thus, he tries to run, obfuscating and circumventing the inevitable, hoping to bypass his destiny.  Finally, however, destiny catches up: "She's coming…"

With his condition worsening, Prior loses control: "I'm scared.  I can't do it again… Oh God, I want to be done." And then she comes, the great angel—she listens to his call.  He is ready to accept fate, and she comes to facilitate it.  Human emotion, however, gets in the way.  Hannah preaches solidarity, saying, "An angel is just a belief, with wings and arms that can carry you.  It's naught to be afraid of.  If it lets you down, reject it.  Seek for something new."  This platitude resonates with the ailing prophet.  Whereas he was content with death, he now—immediately and suddenly—insists on life, no thought, no deliberation.  Hannah's optimism overwhelms him, and faced with the angel's presence, he plays out his tragic flaw—he wrestles the angel.  Much like the tragic heroes of yore, he pursues his decision with great vigor.  His compels his immune-suppressed body into action against a supernatural force.  Highlighting the irrationality, he somehow wins.  His unbelievable fervor and energy overwhelm the angel, and she grants his passage to heaven to return the text of the prophesy.

In heaven, Prior only compounds his error.  Given a tour of heaven, a free pass into paradise, he still decides to go back.  He witnesses heaven's peaceful serenity, the quiet stagnancy, but he stays committed to life on earth. The council of angels tries to reason with him.  Europa says, "This is the Tomb of Immobility… drink it and never thirst again." Prior responds, "I can't… Even sick.  I want to be alive."  Finally, the Angel pleads with him, "You only think you do.  Life is a habit with you…."  Reluctant and obstinate, Prior rebuffs, "Bless me anyway…  I can't help myself.  I do… I recognize the habit. The addiction to being alive….  It's so much not enough, so inadequate but…  Bless me anyway.  I want more life."  In that, he admits his own irrationality.  He equates living to addiction, a mindless repetition or habit.  Even that is not enough, but somehow he still desires earth with AIDS, alone, and hopeless. He asks for a blessing, but he leaves not knowing if he received it.  He returns to earth to play out his tragic existence, damned to the pains and anguish of disease and mortality

<h3>The Big Picture</h3>

Our emotional core levels with Prior.  He made the conscious decision to persevere.  It is the human choice.  The choice Hamlet makes, the choice the depressed but lucky teenage girls makes, the choice we all make to live. Prior character only exemplifies it since he saw heaven, experienced it, but still said no.  Hamlet chose "to be" out of indecision and ignorance, but Prior actively and knowingly pursued a life of terrors.  In that sense, he became the America tragic hero.  The ills of progress are as obvious as they are terrible, as pervasive as poisonous.  America's core is built on its progress.  Manifest Destiny, the New Frontier, science, industry, commerce…  American identity is built off restlessness and desire.  Authors since Alexis de Tocqueville have known this, and Kushner tactfully chose to place the angels in America.

Regrettably, the tragedy is inevitable.  We rationalize everyday travesties with seemingly happy endings: the pleasant paycheck, the filled dinner table, and the promise of another day.  These emotions only help us stomach the human tragedy, of a life destined for—to quote Harper—"a kind of painful progress."

<h3>The Catharsis</h3>

Yet no tragedy ends without a final catharsis.  Catharsis has two conflicting definitions in the literary sense.  Some argue the catharsis is the final emotional purging and purification, when the play "through pity and fear effect[s] the proper purgation of these emotions." [11] Leon Golden, an Aristotelian scholar, makes way for another interpretation.  "The Greek word katharsis can mean 'clarification," I argue that the internal argument of Poetics demands that we interpret catharsis as an 'intellectual clarification.'" [12]  Thus, tragedy—or any art—should strive for the clarification or exposition of the emotional tensions in the work, and in tragedy that should be pity or fear.

The final scene of Angels in America does not purge pity, fear, or even indignation—the comedic sentiment—it sends a mixed signal of frozen progress and forced relations, of hope and despair, of a people and a nation knowingly and pleasantly killing themselves.  It does, however, teach us something about the human condition; that—if nothing else—when we know our failings and our inevitable destinies, we find a way to survive.  We may not make the best of it, but we make something.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[What are the consequences of consent in a democratic society? This is the question political thinker Benjamin Ginsberg takes up in his aptly titled, old, yet still relevant book, <a href="http://books.google.com/books/about/The_consequences_of_consent.html?id=naaFAAAAMAAJ"><em>The Consequences of Consent</em></a>. Ginsberg argues that rulers can use elections to secure authority and acquiescence from the ruled.  Elections bolster popular support for political leaders, since they offer the appearance of responsiveness. Also, elections help to persuade citizens to obey, since they function as an expression of consent on subsequent policy. In fact, elections with actual choice garner the most support and capture the greatest willingness from a people to submit, though simply increasing the franchise or frequency of elections cannot overcome deep-seated apathy or distrust of the government. Nonetheless, on a lower level, elections also tend to lift public attitudes towards the government itself and to the candidates—even those of the losers, as long as they participated. For non-voters, these trends do not apply: their disinterest or distaste grows in election season. Thus, Ginsberg argues, governments should limit electoral barriers and encourage participation from all levels of society, high and even low. By incorporating the people into the process, the regime gains greater ability to extract taxes and services with a minimum of force, Ginsberg argues with substantiating empirical evidence: he writes, “Among the democracies, It would seem, governments’ ability to extract revenues is more closely linked to electoral participation than to the amount of force at the state’s disposal.”  

But -- according to Ginsburg -- elections have also contributed to the growth of states’ power in the twentieth century, which in turn has had an effect on electoral processes, as well. As the state has grown, decision-making has shifted from the ballot box to the administrative office, sapping the clout of electoral politics, and at the same time, the national regulation of electoral processes has politicized them more, sparking the organization of numerous interests and groups. With more pressure groups come more bias and corruption. Ginsburg offers empirical evidence that in a way congressional votes are for sale—and on the cheap. But even the campaign and ethical regulation has had mixed results. Intending to equalize impact or at least curb special interest, campaign regulations in a way inhibit competition and tend to replace politics with government. Moreover, the elections that would define the government are being increasingly defined by the government. Ginsburg offers three “fundamental changes” that have insulated the government from the electoral process: “the expansion of rule through law; the growth of administration; and the conversion of policymaking to an institutional process.”  The government was one ad hoc, reactive, specific, responsive, but now it is more proactive, broad, and disconnected. Citizens seem not to mind, happily placated with frequent elections that in fact only enhance the “state’s power, authority, and capacity to control…”

Ginsberg does offer one consolatory note: “democratic modes of governance appear to be the most compatible with the existence of some measure of individual freedom.”  But he is quick to offer context: “democratic institutions are often consequences rather than antecedents of freedom.”  It is when citizens are free from governmental control that they are offered the opportunity to substitute that freedom for participation: they consent to be governed, Ginsburg claims. With that bargain comes high expectations, and accordingly citizens tend to accept an expansive state, hoping for a helpful one. This is the fundamental paradox of freedom and democracy. To paraphrase Ginsberg and Tocqueville, citizens embrace the freedom dangled by the state; they wrap themselves up in their own chains.]]></content:encoded>
