One of many amazing things my alma mater, <a href="http://cmc.edu">Claremont McKenna College</a>, does for its students is run a <a href="http://itab.cmc.edu">Silicon Valley Networking</a> trip. Short version: they take a dozen of tech-minded students on an all-expense paid tour of the valley, connecting them with alums at like of Google, Facebook, etc. Not a bad way to spend a few days of winter vacation. There are too many good things I can say about the trip -- it's what forced me to shake off my fantasy of being Alan Shore and get serious about tech, just to name one -- and based on its increasing popularity at CMC, I don't need to say much. I spoke to the crew last night, and it was clear that in just a few years the trip had already succeeded in generating more on-campus interest in technology and entrepreneurship.

Last weekend, a member of this year's trip emailed me asking how to fully take advantage of the opportunity, and since it <em>is</em> such a great opportunity, I thought I'd share my response... for whatever it's worth: 

<ul>
	<li><strong>Soak it all up</strong> -- these are all new experiences and people. Don't rush to judgement or let your mind wonder. Listen to what's being said and think about what resonates.</li>
	<li><strong>Consider fit</strong> -- More than pay, title, or location, fit matters; where you think you'll enjoy going to work every day. Pay attention to that during your tours.</li>
	<li><strong>Don't be a empty shirt</strong> -- A smart guy - really smart - just told me that every time he speaks to b-school kids, they ask for his card promising a follow-up, and he knows they never will. He hates it, as he should; it's disrespectful. Don't run to the front of the class for a handshake and card unless you actually care and will actually follow up. Take your time and theirs seriously.</li>
	<li><strong>Talk to the employees</strong> -- You're lucky to get time with bigshots in every company, but they're media trained and trained and trained. They can sell the party line. Talk to the other people in the room, the new hires, the assistants. They'll give you more insight into the actual workings of a company.</li>
	<li><strong>Think about their products</strong> -- Each company has great perks, great salaries, and great people; what separates companies at the most base level, are their products. Which one excites you? Which one do you think, "wow, that's cool"? That's who to go after.</li>
	<li><strong>CMC is a cult, a powerful one</strong> -- Make strong and meaningful connections to the people on the trip and the people you meet that you think you'll need. I recently heard a valuable lesson, "Grow your network before you need it." CMC is an admittedly small but a strong network. If you find alums on the trip you find interesting, talk to them, ask interesting questions, and then follow-up after the fact. They'll be happy, proud, and a bit self-interested in helping you out.</li>
	<li><strong>Internships are the gateway drug </strong>-- This isn't stressed enough for non-econ majors, but internships at major companies are you best way into them. When I got my Google internship, I thought it was a one-in-a-million chance getting the full-time gig. Turns out it was one-in-83; much better odds. Of course getting in the internship was like 1-in-3,000. Nonetheless, still better odds. All the major companies have internship programs, and they getting you hooked from a young age -- yes, a little like drug dealers -- so youth is actually a good thing.</li>
</ul>
