<blockquote>In another move “to promote transparency and accountability” through big data, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti has hired the city’s first chief data officer. Abhi Nemani will collaborate with city departments to collect and analyze data and oversee operations of L.A.’s new open-data portal. Nemani will also “create tools to use data that will help solve everyday challenges for our residents,” Garcetti said in a statement.
