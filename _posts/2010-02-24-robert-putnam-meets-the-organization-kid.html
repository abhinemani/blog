<h3><strong><em>...And He Won’t Bowl Alone</em></strong></h3>
“I have two majors, an overloaded curriculum, and three jobs. But the majority of my time isn't spent in class, studying, or doing work. Meetings and emails overload my Crackberry. It’s muted but its constant vibrations remind me: I don’t have time to bowl alone. I pencil in dates and plan out parties; I’m social, but scheduled. Hi, I’m Organization Kid.<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a> Great to meet you Dr. Putnam, but can we walk while we talk?”

A bewildered Robert Putnam: “I guess so.”<a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a><!--more-->

“Great. I’m really happy David Brooks arranged our little chat. Your work gets a lot of play here: Psychology, IR, Gov—the professors love you. The students… not so much.”

More surprised than offended, Putnam asks, “Why do you say that? Conservative school with a public-service bend, Claremont McKenna, I figured, would appreciate not only the traditionalism of social capital, but also its power. You kids want to run the world, don’t you? This is what makes the world run.”

“Right, we do, and we get it,” the kid reassures him, continuing, “The theory is well known. Society is knit together by dense networks of associations, and that fabric facilitates collective action. Since you’re bound to the group, you work with the group.” He pauses and then concludes, “It’s kind of like large-scale peer pressure. Yes, this is college, and we get that.”

“Not bad, if a bit simplified. There are more meaningful effects too.” The conservation seems more like lightning-round sparring. “Networks of civic engagement house the memories of cooperative success, which serve as a kind of template for future action. You learn how to get things done—together. Plus, the networks of interaction broaden the participants' sense of self, developing the ‘I’ into the ‘we.’ And for <em>my</em> sake, do you mind if <em>we</em> sit down for a bit?”

Glancing at his phone first, the kid smiles and responds, “Of course, let’s make this a lunch.“ They head toward the dining hall, without skipping a beat, the kid continues: “Now, Dr. Putnam, to be fair, I’ve heard that story before. First semester, freshman year: Introduction to American Politics. And, well, it was more eloquently put by a Frenchman, Alexis de Tocqueville.”

“I owe a lot to Tocqueville. He was the modern forefather of this whole school of thought. One of the first to recognize the connections between mores and institutions, between civil society and politics. My social capital is his self-interest rightly understood with charts and graphs.” Putnam now had a humbled tone, “I am really just elaborating on and quantifying his thinking.”

“I like it: you’re our civil society accountant.” He adds a light laugh to ensure the quip isn’t rendered insolence. “I bet it’s tough, though, to quantify associational psychology. I’m curious, how did you decide upon methodology?” Posing that question, he directed them toward seats at the end of table already cluttered with clusters of chatty coeds.

Putnam sets this things down and explains, “Tocqueville had his travels; I had my surveys. There’s a wealth of information on public attitudes and activities, and I map certain traits to trends in social capital in contemporary America. It’s basically an input-output study—with many variables. The inputs are the causes of social capital—associational activity, familial ties, and the like; the outputs are its effects—civic participation and societal trust.”

“But no interviews right?<a href="#_ftn3">[3]</a>” The kid was getting somewhere.

“No, casual interviews would not have been academically rigorous,” he rebuffed. “This was a political science study.”

“They were good enough for Tocqueville. Well, they were all he had, but through his casual interviews he produced your school of thought. More importantly, he was able to connect his observations to the democratic experience, the <em>what</em> to the <em>why</em>.” Putnam had fallen into the kid’s trap: “From my reading, <em>why</em> is a question you have some trouble with.”

“I’ll admit that. I offer some possible explanations for the decline in social capital, but I can’t do more than infer. That said, the evidence of decline (of both inputs and outputs) is staggering.”

“Right, I remember: bowling leagues have floundered, and with them, the social interactions and civic conversations over beer, pizza, and pretzels that solo bowlers do without.” The kid was nearly quoting Putnam’s essay, “now, we bowl alone.”

“Yes, that one of the more whimsical examples; it illustrates the trend. Social capital inputs have dropped.” This was his familiar line. Now he was working from muscle memory, “Since the 1960s, Churchgoing slipped from roughly 15 percent. Since the mid-1950s, when union membership peaked, the nonagricultural union rosters have cut by more than half. The Boy Scouts are off by 26 percent since 1970, and the Red Cross off by 61. In sum, after expanding steadily throughout most of this century, many major civic organizations have experienced a sudden, substantial, and nearly simultaneous decline in membership over the last decade or two. We aren’t just bowling alone, we’re living alone.”

Overwhelmed but still in control, the kid queries, “We’ll come back to that. What about outputs? How do you know those declines translate to less trust or cooperation?”

“We measured them. From a relative high point in the early 1960s, voter turnout had by 1990 declined by nearly a quarter, and kids your age are the culprits, with youth voting in 2000 at tepid levels. The trend persists outside the voting booth: the proportion of Americans who socialize with their neighbors has slowly but steadily declined over the last two decades, from 72 percent to 61 percent. Even worse, the proportion of Americans saying that most people can be trusted fell by more than a third between 1960, when 58 percent chose that alternative, and 1993, when only 37 percent did. We are less connected to each other and less trusting of each other. That’s a net loss of social capital.”

“All due respect, Dr. Putnam, I think here’s where your argument shows its age.” He was somehow both polite and combative. “Maybe we <em>were</em> less connected to each other, but now we <em>aren’t</em>. You know how I know? While we’ve been talking my Blackberry has buzzed about 10 times.” The kid hands over his blinking toy.

The professor was amused, “Explain.” And the professor became the student.

“You’re right: the traditional structures of communication and associations have fallen down, but new, more diffuse ones have cropped up in their place. Your vision of community centers and bowling leagues is dated. I am in constant contact with my friends and family, and my personal network grows constantly: MySpace, Facebook, Linkedin. Online social networks are the modern town square. We talk, we debate, we laugh, and we even flirt. Hard as it is to believe, there’s real human interaction on a global scale happening constantly.”<a href="#_ftn4">[4]</a>

“But you’ve just individualized leisure,” intimating he’d heard this tact before. “See, these technological trends may in fact be atomizing society, entrenching you all behind your laptops. You don’t bowl at all; you play video games. Your computer is basically a modern television, which has made our communities wider and shallower. You don’t have to leave the house to be entertained, so you don’t. We used to come together at movie theaters, at shopping malls, in parks, but now you can watch, shop, and relax all on your own. Technology may in fact be driving a wedge between our individual interests and our collective interactions. I’m left to ask, how does this technology facilitate <em>meaningful</em> social interaction?”

“The same way we have it in the non-wired world. Peer pressure.” He searched for a moment and then returned, “Have you heard of <em>Causes</em>?” Without waiting for a response, he continues, “It’s an online organization and application that have changed the way non-profits win support. Instead of solely relying on big donors or large contributions, they’ve infiltrated social networks thanks to some clever engineering and gone viral. Members can “support” organizations with funds (online contributions), door knocks (emails), or just advertising space (a badge) on their profile. Just as importantly, each time one of your friends joins on, you’re reminded of what you could be doing. That’s one of the many reasons charitable giving and support are <em>at record levels</em>.<a href="#_ftn5">[5]</a> Your metrics are off.”

Putnam grew defensive, “Donations alone don’t instill a sense of membership. Remember your Tocqueville: you have to work together to accomplish something.”

“We’re doing that too. Online and off. Just because there aren’t protests or rebels doesn’t mean we aren’t engaged and connected. Your stats on civic participation, by the way, are way off.”

“How do you know?”

“You <em>really</em> think we aren’t political,” the kid insinuated disbelief. “Two of my internships were in politics, and I’m majoring in government. Plus, youth turnout is on the rise. In the 2008 presidential election, there were 3.4 million more voters as compared to the 2004. Compared to 2000, the increase in youth turnout is at least 11 percentage points. In general, overall turnout has returned to the highs of the 60s.

Impressed, Putnam rebuffs, “It is not just the voting booth that matters. My research showed that from 1973-1993, the numbers of Americans who attended one civic meeting annually has fallen by more than a third. You might be voting, but are you engaged in the broader process?”

“We’ve matched that turnout with enthusiasm. In the last presidential campaign, millions of young people not only voted, but also volunteered. In part, we’ve moved the discussion from the town hall online: 12 percent of us have posted their own political commentary or writing to an online newsgroup, website or blog.<a href="#_ftn6">[6]</a> And we get it: communities matter. 63 percent of us believe the role of government should be to promote the principle of a strong community, and 71 percent think political engagement was an effective way of solving important issues facing our community.<a href="#_ftn7">[7]</a> Plus, we have more and new communities. Consider the open-source movement. Better yet, you must know of wikis.”

“I <em>am</em> a professor.”

“Exactly. Consider the prominence wikipedia has had in our daily dialogue and study. Have a question? First thing we do is google or wiki it. No answer? We’ll keep looking any then update the wikipedia page ourselves.  It’s a community driven dictionary, and though you may not, we trust it—at least as a springboard. These open-sourced—that is group run and developed—projects have upended traditional production schemes. Software isn’t made by one guy sitting in his dorm room; it’s made by hundreds spread across the globe, each chipping in and working together to constantly improve the product. Your generation had groupthink. For us, it’s group-do.” The kid was pleased with himself.

Putnam didn’t let up, “But do you do good? If all you’re doing is helping yourself or wasting time, your associations are trivial and meaningless. Associations are supposed to broaden self-interest. A note-sharing website doesn’t embody democratic virtue.”

“I remember these chapters from <em>Democracy in America</em>. We have to learn the ‘art of being free.’ Well, no one had to teach me. I’m a member of five campus organizations, I have summer internships at NGOs, and I help with student government. We don’t just associate online, we work together on the ground, too. I remember, a friend saying ‘I hadn't been on campus more than five minutes before I started hearing about all the students who do community service—tutoring at a charter school in Trenton, working at Habitat for Humanity-style building projects, serving food at soup kitchens.’ So they have similar resumes, I mean commitments too.”

Surprised, Putnam ask, “Why?  You are double-majoring at a prestigious institution, and you have a job. How do you have time to socialize and associate?”

“It’s what we do,” the kid said as a matter of fact. “It’s a feverishly competitive world out there, and since I was young, the insistence has always been on success. I always knew that I would have to work hard to do well, but I trusted the system, the meritocracy. If I earned it, I would get it. It’s a national trend too. Consider sales of Baby Einstein or Ritalin: parents are honing their children’s potential. They know they have to work to let their children succeed.”

“Why do you trust the system? Why not be yourself or rebel?”

“We live in the age of the SAT, No Child Left Behind, and the Common Application. Results matter—test results, mostly. Of course, a college education is essential, but the caliber of the school matters too. For admissions, you are measured 11 inches tall and 8.5 inches wide. To succeed, you have to pitch yourself in a certain way, conform to the idea of a perfect applicant. So we live our lives reaching for that ideal application.”

“You’re <em>restless in the pursuit of prosperity</em>—that’s natural. That drive, though, can lead toward individuality, towards opportunism, and away from society,” Putnam warned.

“Not entirely and not always. Our <em>ethos</em> of a meritocracy is essentially beneficent. If I work hard—join those clubs, write those emails, arrange those meetings—sure, I can get a better job and make a lot of money. More important, I can be a successful person. I can be a good friend and parent. I understand there’s a way I’m supposed to act—responsible and conscientious—to do well.”

“Does that mean you’ll commit yourself to public service or you’ll run for office?”

“Maybe, but I’d just as happily run an NGO as I’d manage clients for Bain,” the kid responded ambivalently. “I’ll take any avenue for success and so would my friends.”

“You don’t consider that hypocritical: you want to be good people, but everything good you do just for yourself.”

“No. We understand that personal enrichment can come through community service. We don’t need great acts of service or commitment, just daily, constant work. It’s professionalized communitarianism.”

“So resume building rightly understood? That’s some kind of democratic virtue.”

“Sure, that works. But we don’t talk like that: virtue and the like. We talk about <em>accomplishment</em>, and we accomplish a lot more for ourselves working together.”
