What are the consequences of consent in a democratic society? This is the question political thinker Benjamin Ginsberg takes up in his aptly titled, old, yet still relevant book, <a href="http://books.google.com/books/about/The_consequences_of_consent.html?id=naaFAAAAMAAJ"><em>The Consequences of Consent</em></a>. Ginsberg argues that rulers can use elections to secure authority and acquiescence from the ruled.  Elections bolster popular support for political leaders, since they offer the appearance of responsiveness. Also, elections help to persuade citizens to obey, since they function as an expression of consent on subsequent policy. In fact, elections with actual choice garner the most support and capture the greatest willingness from a people to submit, though simply increasing the franchise or frequency of elections cannot overcome deep-seated apathy or distrust of the government. Nonetheless, on a lower level, elections also tend to lift public attitudes towards the government itself and to the candidates—even those of the losers, as long as they participated. For non-voters, these trends do not apply: their disinterest or distaste grows in election season. Thus, Ginsberg argues, governments should limit electoral barriers and encourage participation from all levels of society, high and even low. By incorporating the people into the process, the regime gains greater ability to extract taxes and services with a minimum of force, Ginsberg argues with substantiating empirical evidence: he writes, “Among the democracies, It would seem, governments’ ability to extract revenues is more closely linked to electoral participation than to the amount of force at the state’s disposal.”  

But -- according to Ginsburg -- elections have also contributed to the growth of states’ power in the twentieth century, which in turn has had an effect on electoral processes, as well. As the state has grown, decision-making has shifted from the ballot box to the administrative office, sapping the clout of electoral politics, and at the same time, the national regulation of electoral processes has politicized them more, sparking the organization of numerous interests and groups. With more pressure groups come more bias and corruption. Ginsburg offers empirical evidence that in a way congressional votes are for sale—and on the cheap. But even the campaign and ethical regulation has had mixed results. Intending to equalize impact or at least curb special interest, campaign regulations in a way inhibit competition and tend to replace politics with government. Moreover, the elections that would define the government are being increasingly defined by the government. Ginsburg offers three “fundamental changes” that have insulated the government from the electoral process: “the expansion of rule through law; the growth of administration; and the conversion of policymaking to an institutional process.”  The government was one ad hoc, reactive, specific, responsive, but now it is more proactive, broad, and disconnected. Citizens seem not to mind, happily placated with frequent elections that in fact only enhance the “state’s power, authority, and capacity to control…”

Ginsberg does offer one consolatory note: “democratic modes of governance appear to be the most compatible with the existence of some measure of individual freedom.”  But he is quick to offer context: “democratic institutions are often consequences rather than antecedents of freedom.”  It is when citizens are free from governmental control that they are offered the opportunity to substitute that freedom for participation: they consent to be governed, Ginsburg claims. With that bargain comes high expectations, and accordingly citizens tend to accept an expansive state, hoping for a helpful one. This is the fundamental paradox of freedom and democracy. To paraphrase Ginsberg and Tocqueville, citizens embrace the freedom dangled by the state; they wrap themselves up in their own chains.
