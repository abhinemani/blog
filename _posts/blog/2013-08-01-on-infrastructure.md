<p>Last year, I spoke at the US Ignite Application Developers Summit. If you don't know, they are building "next generation internet infrastructure"—basically the new gigabit and wireless networks, and then showing what's possible with that kind of connectivity. A random musing on roads: while thinking about their work, I thought about the other forms of public infrastructure, in particular roads. Of course, we need roads to get us places, but what isn't often thought about is what a world looks like without public roads. In a private society, where you can buy land, eventually, every piece of land will be bought up, nearly checkerboard style, until you have 100% coverage. So say you want to get to work. Without roads, each person would have to negotiate with each of neighbors -- each unit of property -- along the way to get there, and eventually you could get stuck, if one of your neighbors is bad people. So, simply enough, public roads -- and public infrastructure -- give us the freedom to get around. But then you have to ask yourself where do you want those road to go. What about a park or City Hall -- commons where people can come together and connect? You'd want your roads to go there as well, right? So it's the responsibility of the folks building the roads -- or public infrastructure -- to think normatively about where people can and should connect and build for that. I bring that up because it reminded us of our work. As folks like US Ignite, Google, etc, are building the next generation of public infrastructure -- the new roads -- it's equally our responsibility to build the new kind of public commons and make sure that people can get there. (I think this is why I've always been attracted to New Deal/WPA-style imagery...)</p>

<p>The other line that came to mind was one from the Federalist Papers, "If men were angels, we wouldn't need government."</p>

<p>I had a chance to speak with a former leader in the City of Chicago. He mentioned in an important comsideration: ethics rules. Put simply, he -- and most other government officials -- can't really talk to their successors under ethics rules banning the revolving door and undue influence. That is to say, if he were to ever leave office, the next CTO wouldn't be able to truly benefit from his experience. His point was that it's on the broader network (CfA, other nonprofits, civic startups, etc) to be a kind of connective tissue, administration-to-administration as well as official-to-official. In a way, we have an infrastructure debt as a community of innovators: what's the orientation and knowledge base that keeps the momentum moving as new people come into the civic technology space? He said, "Code for America needs to be the source *institutional memory* for civic innovation."</p>

<p>Finally, I had the chance to chat with a leader from a national philanthropic organization focused on cities, and the conversation at the end took a really interesting turn. We started talking about the need for greater leadership in the civic technology space. I mentioned the thinking we've been doing on identifying core outcomes or principles for ideal cities, and that resonated with them. They were saying that it feels like this movement hasn't been clear on its goals and impacts that are clear, measurable, and agreed upon, and I pushed back that we need to ensure, though, that we don't take an deterministic-style, top-down approach, and keep the space for emergent outcomes and creativity -- we were all agreed. </p>

<p>While chatting, the notion that it's our *responsibility* to do this kept coming up, not just for ourselves but for the broader movement -- that we can play an organizing role, connecting the various initiatives and aligning them on a common set of principles and goals -- which should force mutliply our work.</p>
<p>Kept thinking about that idea, "responsibility..."</p>
<p>The phrase that came to mind while we were talking as one from political philosophy: ordered liberty. Put simply, it means that freedom in a democracy isn't a wholesale lack of rules or responsibilities -- that's anarchy. Instead, freedom has a value set attached to it that give it meaning: equality, fairness, security, etc. So we can have freedom to do (mostly) whatever we want, but also values that indicate what we ought. Here's an illustrative quote from Tocqueville:</p>
<blockquote>“Now would I have you mistake the point of your own liberty. There is a liberty of corrupt nature, which is affected by men and beasts to do what they list; and this liberty is inconsistent with authority, impatient of all restraint… But there is a civil, a moral, a federal liberty, which is the proper end and object of authority; it is a liberty for that only which is just and good.” </blockquote>
<p>Or as another put it: "...liberty is not to be defined as the ‘power of doing what we like, but the right of being able to do what we ought."</p>

<p>Now bringing that down a level, these is a kind of port of the venture-capital, moneyball style strategy. VC's, as you know, develop funds around investment theses. For instance, Union Square Ventures believes in the power of networks to get exponential value; then with that thesis, they have the freedom to fund dozens of companies to test it out, all tying back to that key belief, which knits the investments together and gives the broader portfolio meaning.</p>

<p>Then pulling all of that together, I think we have the responsibility to articulate this set of values and principles that give more meaning to our movement's work. Not to stop chaos, but to control it. It's not a perfect metaphor, and maybe it doesn't make sense. But to me, I really like the idea of this kind of "ordered liberty" for our work, building 21st century cities.</p>
