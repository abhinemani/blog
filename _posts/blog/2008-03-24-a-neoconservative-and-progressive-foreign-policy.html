There’s a common and visceral response in foreign policy; it’s the gag reflex that replaces engagement with nativism, activism with pacifism. We saw this in the wake of World War I and Vietnam, and now, the Iraq debacle may trigger another. Tired of this misguided and mismanaged war, the United States may again capitulate to isolationism at the end of President Bush’s term. Progressives now seem poised to trumpet victory on the graves of Bush Doctrine and the neoconservative tradition, and withdrawal seems to be the favorite (and only) rejoinder. But contrarianism is not a foreign policy, and isolationism is a bad one. We shouldn’t simply walk away from the neocons, but walk over them, continuing down the path to human freedom, but leaving behind the disruptive vestigials of unilateralism.
Moving ahead first demands proper appreciation. However tragic the effects of the Bush Doctrine, it had serious philosophical and historical grounding.

It was born, understandably, in the wake of 9/11. As President George W. Bush explained, the United States would not only defend against terrorists but also root out the state sponsors who aided and abetted them. This formed the logic of the first half of the Bush Doctrine, which led to the ousting of the Taliban in Afghanistan. National security, though, is a common impetus. The full Bush Doctrine—that is, the neoconservative agenda—goes further: “freedom and fear are at war.” In that, Bush accrediting the security threat to the ideologies that fostered fear. But when your enemy isn’t merely a population, but an emotion, the fight would take on multiple fronts. Enter the War in Iraq and Middle East democratization. Bush justified his ambition with faith in history: “History also has a visible direction,” he waxed in his second inaugural address. The promotion of freedom was not merely a moral imperative but a historical inevitability. Years before, Truman warned against turning a “deaf ear” to withering democracies, and Bush restated the U.S. goal to “help others find their own voice, attain their own freedom, and make their own way.” If they weren’t asking, according to Bush, they just didn’t know how to vocalize it yet. The Bush Doctrine would teach them, confident that freedom was their desire and the “longing of the soul.” So if history had a direction, Bush would add speed and magnitude.

With this insistence on both preemption and presumption, Bush overstepped. Preemption lacks legal legitimacy, and we lack the military means. International backlash demonstrates the former and military depletion the latter. Moreover, Iraq has yet to warm to democracy, so successful democratization may require more than longing souls and distant voices. In Iraq, neoconservatives miscalculated both our power and others’ potential.

Moving forward, though, progressives should not disregard this neoconservative legacy. That would be to abandon our own historical tradition.

Remember that Truman preached, “God has created us and brought us to our present position of power and strength for some great purpose.” FDR had his Four Freedoms. Even Kennedy let every nation know “that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe, in order to assure the survival and the success of liberty.” In fact, they matched rhetoric with policy: Wilson took us into World War I and then strived to build a League of Nations. FDR responded to the Old World’s call for assistance and then championed the U.N. Kennedy followed up the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan with the Peace Corps and the (albeit short-lived) Alliance for Progress.

Moral imperatives and freedom promotion have been in the progressive vocabulary for quite some time. In fact, they typify the progressive ideology, an ideology that strives to alleviate human suffering, construct structures of peace, and share the burden thereafter.  Internationally and even domestically, it’s an ideology that emphasizes the role of institutions in realizing and maintaining progress.
In that, progressivism seems to share a philosophical tradition with neoconservatism. Both lay claim to the American creed, defending human dignity and trumpeting American exceptionalism. More interestingly, both seem to share an appreciation for government. Leading neocon, Peter Berkowitz conceded, “[Neoconservativism] recognizes that government, while often part of the problem, can also be part of the solution…” A progressive wouldn’t disagree. But neoconservatives misinterpreted that principle. They employed the wrong institution.

Historically, progressives emphasized the role of international institutions and alliances in foreign policy, accepting the limits of U.S. influence and respecting the sovereignty of others. Neoconservatives hijacked this history. They derided the efficacy of the U.N., intensified security concerns, and emboldened the moral imperative. Thus, when the international community balked, they resorted to unilateralism. They expected that the U.S. government could be the solution to the world’s problems. Iraq, though, taught them the pitfalls of hubris.
The United States cannot be the only solution to the world’s problems. But, as we’ve seen in the past, we can be part of it, and even the leader. Ambition, though, must be channeled and tempered through legitimate institutions, and, there, civility is always a virtue. So is patience. Going forward, progressives and (neo)conservatives would do well to remember both.
