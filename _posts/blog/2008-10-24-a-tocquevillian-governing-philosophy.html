<h3><strong>How 1830s Political Theory Made a Come Back in the 1990s</strong></h3>
The 1990’s staged something of a political resurgence for Alexis de Tocqueville. His tome on American democracy had been a much-quoted textbook for decades, but as the nation neared the 21<sup>st</sup> century, the French aristocrat of centuries past was surprisingly popular in the bully pulpit. Leaders from both sides of the aisles laid claim to the Tocquevillian legacy. Two of his most vocal heirs illustrate his ubiquity: Republican Newt Gingrich and Democrat Bill Clinton. These students translated their reading of Tocqueville’s sense of American exceptionalism into part of their governing philosophy. Upon consideration, Clinton’s appropriation, though, seems incomplete—almost peripheral—whereas the Gingrich’s seems serious—and more foundational. Both tried to identify the greatness of America with its “goodness,” but Gingrich’s conservatism—federalist, regulatory, and openly religious—was better able to inherit the Tocquevillian democratic conception.
<h2>Tocqueville’s Democracy: Three Exceptional Causes</h2>
Tocqueville’s <em>Democracy in America</em> lends itself to political appropriation in a sense. The energetic and insightful work paints a seemingly positive view of American democracy and culture and many of his hypotheses came through, adding legitimacy to his perspective. He saw social and political democratization as a providential fact with potentially barbarous results, but he also saw American democracy <em>work</em>, preserving liberty and confounding ancient and even his own fears.  Thus, he could conclude that it could survive and even thrive thanks to its distinct character and structure, a conclusion nationalist politicians would happily appropriate. Though he warned against generalizations, pithy abstractions decorate his work, tempting American rhetoricians—and they often take the bait, quoting choice lines often without the accompanying argumentation. Thus, to gauge the fidelity of their use, we must first understand Tocqueville’s argument on American exceptionalism.

Much unlike his students, Tocqueville’s offers qualification and context at the outset, writing, “A thousand circumstances independent of the will of man facilitate the maintenance of a democratic republic in the United States.”<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a> Yet through his analysis, he discerned three essential causes that contribute to the “maintenance of the democratic republic in the United States,” <a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a> the federal form, the local, free institutions, and the rule of law.

“The first [cause for success of the American republican democracy] is that federal form of government which the Americans have adopted, and which enables the Union to combine the power of a great republic with the security of a small one.”<a href="#_ftn3"><sup><sup>[3]</sup></sup></a> Tocqueville found considerable value in the American system of federalism. In fact, he argued that this characteristic—among others—made this instance unique and capable of confounding the history of failed republics. Moreover, he even ventured that, “a great republic will always be exposed to more perils than a small one.”<a href="#_ftn4"><sup><sup>[4]</sup></sup></a> The Frenchman maintained that a large republic played host to a larger choir of impassioned men, and harking the Federalists’ line, unchecked human passion could spell demise for a republican democracy. Small states can control those passions more, but they oft suffer from weakness. Thus, he concluded, “The federal system was created with the intention of combining the different advantages which result from the magnitude and the littleness of nations.” <a href="#_ftn5">[5]</a>

A strong federal structure allows the national legislator to tend to the general needs of the nation and the state legislator the authority to satisfy his more connected neighbors. In a practical way, this assures responsive and effective governance: “The central government of each <em>state</em>, which is in immediate relationship with the citizens, is daily apprised of the wants that arise in society; and new projects are proposed every year…”<a href="#_ftn6">[6]</a> Thus—though this may have changed now—the federal government has a small, controlled sphere of influence: its actions are rare and its threat to liberty small.

Tocqueville saw another benefit to the American federal form in that it further heighten man’s ability to self-govern. With a strong and responsive state government, one could see the direct effect of one’s participation, emboldening his self-worth and self-autonomy. The unitary form, though, results in ineffective governance and removed control. Tocqueville tied local governance to the cultivation of a “<em>taste for freedom</em>,” and in America he saw this most clearly in the township institutions: “The second [cause of success for the American republican democracy] consists in those township institutions which limit the despotism of the majority and at the same time impart to the people a taste for freedom and the art of being free.” <a href="#_ftn7">[7]</a> Men who have the “art of being free” are capable of sustaining a democracy, through legitimate participation through elections, political associations, and political parties.

In Volume II, he would develop this notion—“the art of being free”—in his discussion of American mores and associational life. He saw in America a robust and energetic civil society, which was not distinct from the political realm, but essentially connected to it. As Dana Villa rightly argues in “Tocqueville in Civil Society,” the townships were a kind of associations, not unlike political or civil associations. <a href="#_ftn8">[8]</a> Each had a distinct character and effect, but together they cultivated the associational nature of American society. Tocqueville would write, “Wherever at the head of some undertaking you see the government in France, or a man of rank in England, in the United States you will be sure to find an association.”<a href="#_ftn9">[9]</a>

The forms of associations—permanent, political, and civil—have different corrective effects but share a corrective mechanism. For Tocqueville, political democracy was just one part of the broader wave of democratization; social democracy—that is the growth of man’s desire for equality of conditions—was another, with a greater effect on the people in a democracy. Though political democracy could enhance liberty, social democracy emboldened equality—a stronger and more dangerous force, according to Tocqueville:

<blockquote>“I think that democratic communities have a natural taste for freedom; left to themselves, they will seek it, cherish it, and view and privation of it with regret. But for equality their passion is ardent, insatiable, incessant, invincible; they call for equality in freedom; and if they cannot obtain that, they still call for equality in slavery. They will endure poverty, servitude, barbarism, but they will not endure aristocracy.”<a href="#_ftn10">[10]</a>
</blockquote>

This passion for equality when hosted in democratic institutions has pernicious effects: materialism, individualism, and majoritarian despotism. Man sees himself as equal to all others, which inflames his ego, turns him into his own affairs, and prepares him for <em>soft despotism</em>. Tocqueville’s fear is thus an atomized and indifferent citizenry, coddled by immense tutelary power of the state.

The art of association combats those effects, tempering individualism and socializing man. As man recognizes the singular potential of institutions, his self-interest learns to identify with group interest. For Tocqueville, this is self-interest rightly understood—that is, self-interest that is aligned with the communities interest. It is the habit generated by associational life that forces man both above himself and into public affairs. Scholar Peter Augustine Lawler identifies this as the remedy to democratic apathy that “enlarges” the heart, sustaining moral space in society. This seems to explain Tocqueville’s bold assertion that, “the principle of self-interest rightly understood appears to me the best suited of all philosophical theories to the wants of the men of our time…[and] their chief remaining security against themselves.”<a href="#_ftn11">[11]</a>

Tocqueville saw great value in the independent and strong judiciary in the United States: “The third is to be found in the constitution of the judicial power. I have shown how the courts of justice serve to repress the excesses of democracy…”<a href="#_ftn12">[12]</a> The American judicial system emphasized the rule of law, and Tocqueville observed that the people were respectful of it. Here he demonstrates how the type of politics—republican democracy—can influence the mores the people, writing, “In the United States everyone is personally interested in enforcing the obedience of the whole community to the law; for as the minority may shortly rally the majority to its principles...” <a href="#_ftn13">[13]</a> Thus, the minority demonstrates a respect for the majority and for the process. There’s an element of self-interest to it, as they hope to one day hold the majority’s position, but also, there is a certain faith in the legal process. These factors allow for peaceful politics, for the majority and minority to work together without great violence or agitation.

Tocqueville, though, pointed out the upshot of a uncompetitive democracy: “The exercise of the right of association becomes dangerous, then, in proportion as great parties find themselves wholly unable to acquire the majority.” <a href="#_ftn14">[14]</a>

Tocqueville accredits religion, in part, for American’s acceptance of the rule of law. In “Morality &amp; Politics in Modern Life,” Stephen Baron rehearses the argument well:

<blockquote>“[Religion] tightens the moral ties on mankind at exactly the moment when the political ties on it have been weakened. And just when doubt threatens to condemns him to ‘anarchy’ and ‘impotence,’ religion provides man with ‘clear, precise, intelligible… and very durable’ ideas about his existence. Religion thus imposes a ‘salutary control’ on man’s intellect, effectually limiting the ways in which he conceives of happiness… Religion ‘imposes on each man some obligations towards mankind to be performed in common with the rest of mankind.’”<a href="#_ftn15">[15]</a>
</blockquote>

Thus, religion matures man from petty insolence to learned acquiescence. Not only does it buttress the rule of law, but it also softens self-interest, in much the same way associations do. In that, Tocqueville considers religion one of democracy’s chief institutions, one deeply evident throughout American history and one aptly solidified in the Constitution.

Tocqueville thus identified three exceptional characteristics in American democracy: the federal form, the township institutions, and the peaceable judiciary. Each of these legal forms connects to deeper social phenomenon—associational life, self-interest rightly understood, and religion—which present remedies to democracy’s despotic, apathetic, and anarchic ills. His argumentation, though flawed in some places, is robust and multifaceted, a complexity, we’ll see, not often mirrored in his political heirs.
<h2>Clinton’s New Covenant</h2>
President Bill Clinton was fond of quoting Alexis de Tocqueville. The American Presidency Project lists 21 instances of direct citation, far more than the closest Democratic competitor (Carter and Kennedy with two each) and near the high standard of his predecessor, Bush senior.<a href="#_ftn16">[16]</a> He even gave Tocqueville a prime-time airing with a mention in the 1995 State of the Union:

If you go back to the beginning of this country, the great strength of America, as de Tocqueville pointed out when he came here a long time ago, has always been our ability to associate with people who were different from ourselves and to work together to find common ground. And in this day, everybody has a responsibility to do more of that. We simply cannot wait for a tornado, a fire, or a flood to behave like Americans ought to behave in dealing with one another.<a href="#_ftn17">[17]</a>

With rather imprecise terms, Clinton does seem to grasp one element of Tocqueville’s analysis: the role of associations. Perspectives distort the comparison, though. Tocqueville was stating the process he saw in America; Clinton is lamenting its lack. Thus, whereas Tocqueville explained how Americans became able to find common grounds—that is, rightly understanding self-interest—Clinton calls for that understanding immediately. . He offers the normative, “ought,” in claiming that Americans should behave in a certain way, which aligns with Tocqueville’s clear bias for healthy civil society. Nonetheless, this shift does conflate the means with the result: if associational life cultivates self-interest rightly understood, then without it, democrats would not have that capacity.

In a sense, Clinton is telling the winter to grow the flowers of spring.

To be fair, Tocqueville did allow for the deliberate cultivation of self-interest rightly understood, but in a more nuanced fashion:

<blockquote>I do not think that the system of self-interest as it is professed in America is in all its parts self- evident, but it contains a great number of truths so evident that men, if they are only educated, cannot fail to see them. Educate, then, at any rate, for the age of implicit self-sacrifice and instinctive virtues is already flitting far away from us, and the time is fast approaching when freedom, public peace, and social order itself will not be able to exist without education.<a href="#_ftn18">[18]</a>
</blockquote>

Clinton wrongly attempted exhortation when education was needed. Mores are cultivated, not demanded. He calls on Americans to show daily the same cooperation they show in response to national tragedy, and while he misses the mechanics of associational life, he does touch upon the right theme: responsibility. This theme—responsible citizenship—attends most of Clinton's Tocquevillian speeches. His appropriation of Tocqueville is thus best summarized in the theme of the earlier speech, a New Covenant:

<blockquote>We all gain when we give, and we reap what we sow. That's at the heart of this New Covenant. Responsibility, opportunity, and citizenship, more than stale chapters in some remote civic book, they're still the virtue by which we can fulfill ourselves and reach our God-given potential and be like them and also to fulfill the eternal promise of this country, the enduring dream from that first and most sacred covenant. I believe every person in this country still believes that we are created equal and given by our Creator the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.<a href="#_ftn21">[21]</a>
</blockquote>

In fact, in that passage, he comes closest to fidelity to Tocqueville’s remote civic book. The essential tension between equality and liberty is enshrined in the Declaration of Independence, and as Tocqueville recognized, without an active citizenry the prospect for liberty—already pitted in an uneven fight—seem bleak. A New Covenant to restore an energetic civil society could stall or hopefully reverse the atomization of individualism, and it could require and thus reinvigorate the art of association. Yet, liberty has and requires more allies—namely, decentralization and religion—so Clinton’s exhortations, however noble, belie Tocqueville’s broader and richer analysis.

Clinton’s omission becomes more understandable, though, when put in political context. He did triangulate—offering welfare reform, for example—but he still was the leader of the Democratic Party, who among other policies tried to implement universal healthcare as a federal guarantee. Even though Clintonian liberalism was of a moderate sort—somewhat religious too—his opposition, the Congressional GOP, held more closely to the Tocqueville’s conservative tenants: decentralization and religion.
<h2>Gingrich’s Contract With America</h2>
Political scientists, William F. Connelly Jr. and John J. Pitney Jr. situate the 1994 GOP in the historical Republican tradition:

<blockquote>“Limited government may provide the unifying theme, if the rationale make clear that: free markets are more efficient than large public bureaucracies, and bureaucratic centralization undermines self-government by supplanting community building and character building institutions: family, church, school, and voluntary associations. This core GOP message has time-honored roots in the Reagan Revolution, the Republicanism of Lincoln, and the ideas of Alexis de Tocqueville.”<a href="#_ftn22">[22]</a>
</blockquote>

Not only did their analysis explicitly point to Tocqueville, but so did the new House Speaker Newt Gingrich himself—frequently and passionately, as Scott L. McLean in <em>Social Capital</em> points out:

<blockquote>“Fresh from his 1994 victory, Speaker Newt Gingrich declared from the well of the House of that the triumphant Republicans had based their programs on Democracy in America’s celebration of voluntary action and Frederick von Hayek’s hostility to the regulatory state… Gingrich regularly quoted Tocqueville in support of the Contract With America’s frontal assault on the New Deal.”<a href="#_ftn23">[23]</a>
</blockquote>

In fact, Tocqueville too was hostile to the regulatory state both as an encroachment on the efficient market and as a precursor to soft despotism. Thus, Gingrich aligns rather squarely with the Frenchmen, as evidenced simply by his “Required Reading List.” <em>Democracy in America</em>, he maintained, was mandatory for good Americans.

Gingrich summarizes his reading of Tocqueville in a speech before the Orphan Foundation of America, saying, “America is a great country filled with good people. Tocqueville pointed out in the 1840s that volunteerism, local leadership and faith-based charities were the unique attributes that gave America its dynamic character.”<a href="#_ftn24">[24]</a> Gingrich there touches upon each of the exceptional characteristics Tocqueville’s hailed. The volunteerism connects to associational life; local leadership to decentralization; and faith-based charities to religious underpinnings. Just before that passage, he presents an argument, which further substantiates his stance as a Tocquevillian federalist. Praising a local Young Women’s Christian Association, he advocates local institutions as opposed to centralized bureaucracies, explaining, “This is not a proposal for a massive new government program. If centralized bureaucracies in Washington could have stopped drugs, guaranteed learning and ended single teen pregnancy, the job would have been done—we have created the bureaucracy and spent the money. It was just the wrong model.” <a href="#_ftn25">[25]</a> The right model, it follows, is more federal and less centralized; it’s local.

He takes up the religious underpinnings of American culture, as well, in “Defending God in the Public Square,” from his work, <em>Newt’s Five Challenges</em>.  He cites the Tocqueville’s recognition of the centrality of religion as a democratic institution—an “indispensable to the maintenance of republican institutions.” After decrying the dissenting “secular Left,” he mirrors Tocqueville’s analysis (presented by Baron above) that religion cultivates respect. He quotes Harvard professor Samuel Huntington points out that “Americans tend to have a certain catholicity toward religion: All deserve respect.”<a href="#_ftn26">[26]</a>

Soon after winning the ’94 election, Gingrich praised the character building history of American education, which is cited as a nearly explicit appropriation of Tocqueville: "there was an explicit, long-term commitment to creating character. It was the work ethic, it was honesty, right and wrong, it was not harming others, it was being vigilant in defense of liberty. It was very clear and we taught it."<a href="#_ftn27">[27]</a> America had throughout its history cultivated a Christian ethos: a learned respect for the rule of law and an ingrained sense of morality. Gingrich effectually extended Tocqueville’s argument through the arc of American history.

In “Social Citizenship and a Reconstructed Tocqueville,” Chad Alan Goldberg argues that Newt Gingrich’s New Right falsely laid claim to Tocqueville’s soul. He forcefully cites more obscure writings, which advocate for public relief and welfare, which would contradict a fervent libertarianism. In this, though, Goldberg tackles a straw man, as the New Right—as he admits—housed much cacophony, and Gingrich, himself, was somewhat pragmatic. Consider the above passage regarding centralized bureaucracies: if they could have done it, they would have.  Thus, much like Tocqueville, Gingrich’s views are based in observation and reason. Nonetheless, the point merits appreciation, though, as Tocqueville would not sit comfortably at the plank of either party.

That doesn’t mean that politicians at those ends (or anywhere in between) will stop trying to make him their own. Clinton and Gingrich did, each using Tocqueville to substantiate their general governing philosophy: Clinton’s New Covenant and Gingrich’s Contract With America. In the end, the veracity of Gingrich’s claims may be best seen by Clinton’s own actions. Pestered by the now mandated New Right federalists, the Democratic President announced to Republican glee, “The era of big government is over.”<a href="#_ftn28">[28]</a> Both the young Tocqueville of the Democracy in American and even more the Tocqueville of the <em>Ancient Regime</em> would have been happy to hear that—even without a shout out.
