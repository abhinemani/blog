I was from the very beginning willing to give Code for America my 20 percent, be it my 81st or my 119th. And then some. I was interested in the program from just the first mention, and once I met Jen, I was committed. And this past summer -- working with the team, building the organization, and seeing the impact of our work -- has bordered on surreal; it's been more than I could have imagined. 

See in my life, I've usually felt as if I came to the party a few minutes too late, as if the good ol' days were really the best days: college used be to easier, work simpler, and money freer. "The Masters of the Universe have left..." says Tom Wolfe, and I tended to agree that the era of assumed success was over. Now we'd have to earn it. So I've tried to work -- jealously maybe -- at various institutions to reclaim that legacy of optimism and accomplishment, feeling all the while like I had missed out. My timing was just off.

For the first time in my life, however, things feel different.

Why? Code for America is the perfect storm. It's the right idea with the right people at the right time. The web is changing the way we live, work, and interact with each other, and organizations are able to do more with less -- with a little help from forward thinking geeks. Code for America's beautiful little idea is that government can do the same, all we need to do is get some of those geeks into City Hall. When I learned that little idea was coming to life in a big way, I had to get involved.
