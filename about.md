<p><img src="/images/headshot.jpg" width="40%" style="margin:1em; float: right;"> Abhi Nemani is a writer, speaker, organizer, and technologist. He most recently served as the first Chief Data Officer for the City of Los Angeles, where he led the city's efforts to build an open and data-driven LA. As CDO, Abhi led Los Angeles to <a href="http://abhinemani.com/press/techwire/">#1 ranking for US open data cities</a>, by <a href="http://data.lacity.org/" target="_blank">publishing over 400 datasets</a> and earned the city the Platinum Open Data Certification; to help put that data to work, he mobilized LA's growing developer community by hosting hackathons and app competitions and by building independent non-profits in the community to grow and sustain the open data ecosystem. To drive innovation within city hall, Abhi built a nationally-recognized <a href="http://lamayor.org/dashboard" target="_blank">Mayoral Dashboard</a>, led data and analytics trainings for city staff, and <a href="http://abhinemani.com/press/huffpo/" target="_blank">piloted data science projects to address key policy issues</a>. </p>
<p>Before joining the city, he helped build, launch, and run the national non-profit, <a href="http://codeforamerica.org" target="_blank">Code for America</a>, a technology organization dedicated to reinventing government for the 21st century. Abhi led CfA’s product strategy as its teams tackled local government challenges ranging from transparency and business licensing to food stamps and public safety. He also led the organization's efforts to scale through building multiple new programs: a first-of-its-kind civic startup accelerator, an international volunteer corps, and a collaborative network for hundreds of government innovators. Additionally, Abhi developed the organization’s policy portfolio — working hand-in-hand with area experts and local leaders — to enact over 30 municipal policy reforms on topics including open data, healthcare, and procurement.</p>
<p>Abhi is a Member of the Board of Directors for the <a href="http://opengovfoundation.org" target="_blank">OpenGov Foundation</a>, a member of the Board of Advisors of Significance Labs, and has served as Innovator-in-Residence at GovDelivery.</p>
<p>Previously, Abhi worked for Google, developing social engagement strategies, the Rose Institute, managing multiple local government transparency research teams, and the Center for American Progress, focusing on connecting a national network of public-minded advocates. He graduated magna cum laude from Claremont McKenna College with a honors degree in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics (PPE), and studied political philosophy and rhetoric as the University of Oxford.</p>
<p>Abhi's work <a href="/press">has been featured</a> in the New York Times, Government Technology, Government Executive, and Forbes, and he  <a href="/talks">has been featured as a speaker</a> at SxSW, the World Bank, and various universities and conferences around the world.</p>
